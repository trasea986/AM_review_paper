However, understanding genotypic, phenotypic and ecotypic variation is critical in determining the most suitable sources to conserve historical and functional variation. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) provide a classic example of restoration biology, where management programmes have re-established extirpated populations via translocations. Through this process, translocated individuals may now face novel environments, including new bioclimatic conditions and an opportunity to interbreed with historically isolated and distinct genetic units. Our goal was to integrate genetic and ecological analyses to assess some of the evolutionary ramifications of this important management practice. Location Western North America, but focused on the Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts. Methods We quantified genetic variation across 55 Herds of bighorn sheep using 16 microsatellite loci (N = 347) and a mitochondrial gene (N = 110). We used ordination, Bayesian clustering and phylogenetic analyses to delineate evolutionary units. We used multivariate ordination for 26 ecologically relevant variables to characterize niche-based differences among genetic clusters and then tested whether repatriated populations occupy conditions similar to source areas. Results We document genetic differentiation among three traditional management units of bighorn sheep that now occupy the Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts, but also identify limited hybridization among these groups. Niche-based analyses revealed that translocated populations now occur in conditions incongruent with source ranges. Main conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering both genetic variation and ecological differences when implementing translocations. Early consideration of these variables may help minimize the potential for hybridization among distinct groups and mitigate challenges of managing populations experiencing novel environments. More broadly, results from this study have implications for future restoration efforts in this iconic system, but also for similar translocation-based conservation programmes.","2015","2020-08-18 17:09:15","2020-08-18 22:51:25","2020-08-18 17:09:15","1063-1074",NA,"9","21",NA,"","Translocated to the fringe",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en","¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",NA,NA,NA,"Wiley Online Library",NA,"00007  _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.12329","<p>3 - AG / translocations have been occurring, using genetics to monitor, using usats and mtDNA gets at ecotypes, movement was move for demographic reasons</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\B943GD34\Malaney et al. - 2015 - Translocated to the fringe genetic and niche vari.pdf; C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\MX522XQE\ddi.html","",NA,"translocation; conservation genetics; assisted migration; managed relocation; Admixture; non-analogue niche",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>3 - AG / translocations have been occurring, using genetics to monitor, using usats and mtDNA gets at ecotypes, movement was move for demographic reasons</p>"

In many cases, however, limited funding and other logistic challenges limit the number of individuals available for translocation. In conservation genetics, small populations are predicted to rapidly lose genetic diversity which can deteriorate population survival. Thus, how worried should we be about the loss of genetic diversity when introducing small, isolated populations? Historical species introductions provide a means to assess these issues. Here we review 13 studies of ‚Äúassisted colonization-like‚Äù introductions of animals, where only a small known number of founders established an isolated population without secondary contact to the source population. We test which factors could be important in retaining genetic diversity in these cases. In many cases, loss in heterozygosity (-12.1%) was detected, and more seriously the loss in allelic richness (-27.8 %). Number of founders seemed to have an effect but it also indicated that high population growth rate could help to retain genetic diversity, i.e. future management actions could be effective even with a limited number of founders if population growth would be enhanced. On the contrary, translocated organisms with longer generation times did not seem to retain more genetic diversity. We advocate that, where possible, future studies on translocated animals should report the loss of genetic diversity (both heterozygosity and allelic richness), which is essential for meta-analyses like this one for deepening our understanding of the genetic consequences of assisted colonization, and justifying management decisions.","2015-10-01","2020-08-19 01:25:54","2020-08-19 01:25:54","2020-08-19 01:25:54","827-834",NA,"5","61",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en","",NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>5 - meta analysis of assisted gene flow, summarizing the finding and patterns across 13 translocation case studies, although not climate change specific, ts</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\8V7DT5A9\Kekkonen and Brommer - 2015 - Reducing the loss of genetic diversity associated .pdf","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>5 - meta analysis of assisted gene flow, summarizing the finding and patterns across 13 translocation case studies, although not climate change specific, ts</p>"

Assisted colonization, moving species into regions where they have not previously occurred, aims to establish populations where they are expected to survive as climatic envelopes shift. However, adaptation to the source environment may affect whether species successfully establish in new regions. Assisted colonization has spurred debate among conservation biologists and ecologists over whether the potential benefits to the threatened species outweigh the potential disruption to recipient communities. In our opinion, the debate has been distracted by controversial examples, rather than cases where assisted colonization may be a viable strategy. We present a strategic plan for the assisted migration of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), an endemic New Zealand reptile. The plan includes use of extant populations as reference points for comparisons with assisted-colonization populations with respect to demography, phenotypic plasticity, and phenology; optimization of genetic variation; research to fill knowledge gaps; consideration of host and recipient communities; and inclusion of stakeholders in the planning stage. When strategically planned and monitored, assisted colonization could meet conservation and research goals and ultimately result in the establishment of long-term sustainable populations capable of persisting during rapid changes in climate.","2012-10","2020-09-10 20:24:25","2020-09-10 20:24:25","2020-09-10 20:24:25","790-798",NA,"5","26",NA,"","Securing the Demographic and Genetic Future of Tuatara through Assisted Colonization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en","",NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>this was added manually and was found in our first search type 3 plan for future movement considering genetics and other factors, </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\EC5RMHYX\Miller et al. - 2012 - Securing the Demographic and Genetic Future of Tua.pdf","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>this was added manually and was found in our first search type 3 plan for future movement considering genetics and other factors, </p>"

Suggestions have varied from choosing individuals from the most environmentally similar regions to choosing those that might have the best ability to adapt to new environments. Scott et al. used long-term data collected during translocations of Mojave Desert tortoises, including animals formerly kept as pets, to test these questions. Although the overall rates of survival for all tortoises at the site (both reintroduced and native) were extremely low, translocated individuals with the highest heterozygosity survived at much higher rates than those determined to be similar to the target population. Science, this issue p. 1086 Anthropogenic environmental modification is placing as many as 1 million species at risk of extinction. One management action for reducing extinction risk is translocation of individuals to locations from which they have disappeared or to new locations where biologists hypothesize they have a good chance of surviving. To maximize this survival probability, the standard practice is to move animals from the closest possible populations that contain presumably related individuals. In an empirical test of this conventional wisdom, we analyzed a genomic dataset for 166 translocated desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) that either survived or died over a period of two decades. We used genomic data to infer the geographic origin of translocated tortoises and found that individual heterozygosity predicted tortoise survival, whereas translocation distance or geographic unit of origin did not. Our results suggest a relatively simple indicator of the likelihood of a translocated individual‚Äôs survival: heterozygosity. High heterozygosity improves survival of reintroduced Mojave desert tortoises. High heterozygosity improves survival of reintroduced Mojave desert tortoises.","2020-11-27","2021-01-30 14:08:34","2021-01-30 14:08:34","2021-01-30 14:08:34","1086-1089",NA,"6520","370",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en","Copyright ¬© 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science. https://www.sciencemag.org/about/science-licenses-journal-article-reuseThis is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.",NA,NA,NA,"science.sciencemag.org",NA,"Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science Section: Report PMID: 33243888","<p>4 used Radseq to monitor after movement</p>; <p>not found in lit search, published after we ran it I think</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\WDHF3WGR\Scott et al. - 2020 - Individual heterozygosity predicts translocation s.pdf; ; C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\KSDGTXLN\1086.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243888",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>4 used Radseq to monitor after movement</p>; <p>not found in lit search, published after we ran it I think</p>"

Conservation efforts since 1983 have included survey of the remaining population, establishment of a captive colony and subsequent translocations to both island and mainland sites. Translocations have met with mixed success, with four of 10 (three islands and one mainland site) successful and extant for 19‚Äì28 years, five unsuccessful (one island and four mainland sites) and one as yet indeterminate. Overall, the increase in number of populations, area of occupancy and extent of occurrence has been positive, and has resulted in a down-listing of conservation status. There are numerous plausible explanations for the lack of success at some sites, but few data to differentiate among them. These plausible explanations include: the release of stick-nest rats to habitats of poor quality; high levels of predation (perhaps hyperpredation) by native predators (chiefly monitors and predatory birds) in combination, at some sites, with predation by feral cats or foxes; and ineffective release protocols. Most extant populations have undergone substantial fluctuations over time, and some show apparent long-term declines in abundance, likely increasing their probability of local extinction over time. There is a need for regular ongoing monitoring ‚Äì of stick-nest rats themselves, their habitat and their suite of potential predators ‚Äì to aid interpretation of outcomes. A more experimental approach to future releases is required to adjudicate among competing explanations for such declines.","2019","2020-08-14 17:30:54","2020-08-14 17:30:54","2020-08-14 17:30:54","455",NA,"6","46",NA,"Wildl.

The Australian mainland subspecies of the eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunnii) is extinct in the wild, with surviving populations restricted to small sites protected by predator‚Äìbarrier fences. PVA modelling shows that a self-sustaining bandicoot population would require an area free of the introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) of at least 2500ha. French Island is outside the historic range of the species, but is fox-free and contains around 9000ha of potentially suitable habitat. Aims This study will assess the suitability of French Island as a potential site for a self-sustaining eastern barred bandicoot population by conducting a 1-year assisted colonisation trial to assess habitat use, body condition and survival. Methods Between July and September 2012, 18 adult bandicoots were released. We radio-tracked bandicoots using intraperitoneal radio-transmitters for up to 122 days and trapped fortnightly. Key results The release group met the three measures of success: (1) appropriate habitat use; (2) recovery of post-release bodyweight; and (3) founder survival exceeding 100 days. Habitat use and body condition throughout the trial reflected that of mainland populations, and seven bandicoots survived longer than 100 days. Mortality was greatest in the first month, with veterinary investigations confirming two deaths due to cat predation, two deaths from toxoplasmosis and one unknown cause of death. Bandicoots that survived longer than 100 days occupied higher, drier ground than those that did not. Toxoplasmosis cases were associated with lower topographic position on the site. Conclusions Our results suggest that French Island provides suitable habitat for the establishment of a population of eastern barred bandicoots. On French Island, toxoplasmosis was identified as an important source of mortality in addition to cat predation, and warrants further investigation. Implications Given the costs and challenges of predator control and the maintenance of predator exclusion fences, assisted colonisation to one or more fox-free islands remains the most viable option to establish self-sustaining bandicoot populations. Our results highlight the value in conducting trial releases ahead of major translocations.","2018-01-30","2020-08-18 16:59:22","2020-08-18 22:51:25","2020-08-18 16:59:22","484-496",NA,"7","44",NA,"Wildl.

In addition to following established general guidelines for translocations, detailed planning to account for unique circumstances and intensive post-release monitoring to document outcomes and guide management are essential components of these projects. Recent translocation of the critically endangered Nihoa millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris kingi) provides an example of this planning and monitoring. The Nihoa millerbird is a passerine bird endemic to Nihoa Island in the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The closely related, ecologically similar Laysan millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris) went extinct on Laysan Island in the early 20th century when the island was denuded by introduced rabbits. To reduce extinction risk, we translocated 50 adult Nihoa millerbirds more than 1000km by sea to Laysan, which has recovered substantially in the past century and has ample habitat and a rich prey-base for millerbirds. Following five years of intensive background research and planning, including development of husbandry techniques, fundraising, and regulatory compliance, translocations occurred in 2011 and 2012. Of 11 females in each cohort, 8 (2011 cohort) and 11 (2012 cohort) produced at least one brood of fledglings during their first year on Laysan. At the conclusion of monitoring in September 2014, 37 of the translocated birds were known to survive, and the population was estimated at 164 birds.

In many cases, this will happen naturally, but in others, human intervention may be necessary in the form of ‚Äòassisted colonisation‚Äô. Species re-establishments in suitable parts of their historic ranges provide an opportunity to conserve some species and to test ideas about assisted colonisation. Here, bioclimatic models of the distributions of two extinct British butterflies, Aporia crataegi and Polyommatussemiargus, were used to investigate the potential for re-establishment in Britain. Generalised additive models and generalised linear models were created to describe the species‚Äô European distributions for the period 1961‚Äì1990. All models projected the British climate during this period to be suitable for both species. Thirty-year climate projections for the periods 1991‚Äì2020 and 2021‚Äì2050, and for three climate change scenarios, were then put into the models to generate projections of climatic suitability throughout the 21st century. British climate was projected to remain highly suitable for A. crataegi, but to decline somewhat for P. semiargus. Southern and eastern Britain were found to be the areas most likely to support suitable climate. This difference between the species appeared to be due in part to decreasing summer rainfall in climate change projections, as this should only benefit A. crataegi. It is concluded that, with further study of habitat requirements, both species could be reintroduced to Britain as part of a long-term European conservation strategy.","2009-10-01","2020-08-18 16:51:37","2020-08-18 22:51:26","2020-08-18 16:51:37","2114-2121",NA,"10","142",NA,"Biological Conservation","Climate change and translocations",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","en","",NA,NA,NA,"ScienceDirect","","00043","<p>1- modeling only, no genetics. -B</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\8VPFYK8X\Carroll et al. - 2009 - Climate change and translocations The potential t.pdf; C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\X475QTYV\S0006320709001803.html",NA,NA,"Assisted colonisation; Bioclimatic modelling; Black-veined white; Mazarine blue","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>1- modeling only, no genetics. -B</p>"

Here, we use a case study to demonstrate a spatial conservation planning approach to inform decisions about where, under climate change, to protect and restore critical food and habitat resources for highly specialized species. Location Eastern Australia. Methods We developed fitted models for the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and five of its key eucalypt food trees using the maximum entropy algorithm available in Maxent. We then projected these models using a range of IPCC A1FI climate change scenarios and identified areas with a higher probability of occurrence. We calculated where the koala and its food trees may co-occur under future climate change. Results The koala and its food trees experienced significant range contractions as climate change progressed, sometimes to regions outside their current distributions. The inland species Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus coolabah contracted from the more arid interior, which is outside the koala range, but persisted in the eastern regions of the koala‚Äôs range, while Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus populnea and Eucalyptus tereticornis contracted eastwards and southwards, with a fragmented distribution. The highest probabilities of overlap between koalas and their food trees were identified in fragmented coastal and southern regions of the koala‚Äôs current range. Main conclusions The application of a robust species distribution modelling decision support tool identified important changes, under climate change, in the distribution of a specialist species and its key food trees. These distributions did not change in complete synergy and therefore areas of overlap varied, depending on the food tree species modelled. This is of particular importance in a conservation planning context, when considering targeted protection and restoration of species-specific habitat resources.","2012","2020-08-18 16:36:18","2020-08-18 22:51:26","2020-08-18 16:36:17","847-860",NA,"9","18",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","en","¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd",NA,NA,NA,"Wiley Online Library","","00042  _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00881.x","<p>1 not relevant</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\96PCK3AC\Adams‚ÄêHosking et al. - 2012 - Modelling changes in the distribution of the criti.pdf; C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\XWYWNDJC\j.1472-4642.2012.00881.html",NA,NA,"Maxent; conservation planning; Climate change; eucalypt; habitat resources; koala food trees","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>1 not relevant</p>"

We found that (1) among the 80% who wanted extinction avoided, increased in situ management of wild populations was preferred to captive breeding or assisted colonization, (2) preferences for adaptation strategies were not explained by gender, income, education or knowledge about birds, (3) genetically distinctive taxa were not actively preferred, (4) > 60% of respondents were content for conservation managers to make decisions about strategies rather than local communities or the general public.

"9PBRG3HS","journalArticle",NA,"Dietl, Gregory P; Flessa, Karl W","CONSERVATION PALEOBIOLOGY","","","","","","The science and practice of conservation biology face new challenges in the next few decades that will require application of the vertebrate fossil record. The new challenges are how to preserve not only individual species, but also natural ecosystem function through a time that is seeing unprecedented rates of climate change, human-population growth, and habitat fragmentation. Under these circumstances, linkages between vertebrate paleontology and conservation biology are needed to: (1) deÔ¨Åne the range of normal variation that ecosystems typically experience in their lifespan; (2) provide metrics for monitoring ecosystems that are useful for conservation biologists and benchmarks for recognizing successful ecosystem management; and (3) develop effective conservation strategies for species and ecosystems. Here we summarize some ways vertebrate paleontological work on genetics, populations, species diversity, and extinction is contributing to these needs. For example, the application of ancient DNA techniques in the context of life history strategies provides a means of determining when modern populations are in trouble. Species composition, abundance, and richness in modern ecosystems all can be compared to the paleontological record to assess when an ecosystem is exhibiting unusual changes. Past extinctions offer insights as to how to avoid future ones. New conservation efforts such as assisted migration will require information on which kinds of species substitutions maintained ecological function in the past. We anticipate that as ecosystems require more and more human manipulation to sustain biodiversity, the paleontological record will become even more important as a baseline against which to assess ecological health.","","2021-01-25 15:56:41","2021-01-25 15:56:41","","23",NA,"","",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","en","",NA,NA,NA,"Zotero","","","","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\JMD79FHX\Dietl and Flessa - CONSERVATION PALEOBIOLOGY.pdf",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals",""

Past, current and future use of assisted colonisation","","","","","","Assisted colonisation ‚Äì the translocation of organisms with release in areas outside their indigenous range in response to threats such as climate change ‚Äì was presented in the scientific literature only a few years ago as a new tool for species conservation. The idea of planned introductions for conservation is a controversial issue, prompting vigorous, and sometimes ill-informed, debate in the scientific literature. The broad consensus was that this represented a bold new direction that had merit but carried great risk. Unacknowledged by most commentators, assisted colonisation (by other names) was already taking place, and in Australia and New Zealand was even a long-accepted part of the conservation management tool kit. In 2013, the IUCN recognised assisted colonisation as a legitimate, if inherently risky, conservation translocation, and set out a comprehensive set of guidelines for its application. We review the history of assisted colonisation, with a focus on Australian and New Zealand projects moving species in response to threats within the indigenous range. We review the current status of assisted colonisation in Australia and New Zealand and present two case studies to illustrate the application of new approaches for assisted colonisation planning: Australia‚Äôs western swamp tortoise (Pseudemydura umbrina), and New Zealand‚Äôs hihi (Notiomystis cincta). We conclude by considering future directions in the specific application of translocations for climate change mitigation in the region.","","2021-01-25 14:34:04","2021-01-25 14:34:04","","23",NA,"","",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","en","",NA,NA,NA,"Zotero","","","<p>1 - bookchapter, barely mentioning genetics in a few words</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\3WZ2XGPS\Seddon et al. - 9 Proactive conservation or planned invasion Past.pdf",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Animals","<p>1 - bookchapter, barely mentioning genetics in a few words</p>"

Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO               2               , resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.","2015-02-24","2020-08-14 17:31:07","2020-08-14 17:31:07","2020-08-14 17:31:07","2307-2313",NA,"8","112",NA,"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"<p>5 Suggests that genetic/genomic methods could be used to inform AM; broadly and briefly discuses these topics, but does not in any detail describe genetic/genomic methods to aid/inform AM</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\M58IVT4V\van Oppen et al. - 2015 - Building coral reef resilience through assisted ev.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic and Marine","<p>5 Suggests that genetic/genomic methods could be used to inform AM; broadly and briefly discuses these topics, but does not in any detail describe genetic/genomic methods to aid/inform AM</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

The most widely used approach is the ‚Äúcoral gardening‚Äù tenet; an active reef restoration tactic based on principles, concepts, and theories used in silviculture. During the relatively short period since its inception, the gardening approach has been tested globally in a wide range of reef sites, and on about 100 coral species, utilizing hundreds of thousands of nursery-raised coral colonies. While still lacking credibility for simulating restoration scenarios under forecasted climate change impacts, and with a limited adaptation toolkit used in the gardening approach, it is still deficient. Therefore, novel restoration avenues have recently been suggested and devised, and some have already been tested, primarily in the laboratory. Here, I describe seven classes of such novel avenues and tools, which include the improved gardening methodologies, ecological engineering approaches, assisted migration/colonization, assisted genetics/evolution, assisted microbiome, coral epigenetics, and coral chimerism. These are further classified into three operation levels, each dependent on the success of the former level. Altogether, the seven approaches and the three operation levels represent a unified active reef restoration toolbox, under the umbrella of the gardening tenet, focusing on the enhancement of coral resilience and adaptation in a changing world.","2019-06-28","2020-08-14 18:28:11","2020-08-14 18:28:11","2020-08-14 18:28:11","201",NA,"7","7",NA,"JMSE","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"<p>5 review that discusses (among other things) AM as a potential tool for coral restoration</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\5A2XLZ43\Rinkevich - 2019 - The Active Reef Restoration Toolbox is a Vehicle f.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic and Marine","<p>5 review that discusses (among other things) AM as a potential tool for coral restoration</p>"

However, climate change is not a sole stressor. Most coral reefs around the world are threatened by a myriad of local stressors, including overfishing, destructive fishing, untreated sewage, agriculture effluents (nutrients and pesticides), and siltation due to deforestation. Reefs will not survive the severe effects of this plethora of stressors while waiting until we mitigate climate change. In order to safeguard reefs, we need to adopt a new narrative‚Äî‚Äúthere are diverse ways in which we can improve the chances of saving coral reefs‚Äù‚Äîby acting now to: (i) improve their local protection and marine protected area networks, (ii) alleviate their critical local stressors, (iii) restore degraded and damaged reefs, and (iv) promote reef resilience and adaptation (e.g. adaptation networks, assisted evolution) to the changing conditions, notably climate change effects. It is time for us to move on from the impractical goals of the climate change narrative (‚Äúinterventions beyond our field of expertise‚Äù) to building up resilience and adaptation of social-ecological systems of coral reefs.","2020-01-01","2020-08-14 17:36:15","2020-08-14 17:36:15","2020-08-14 17:36:15","40-45",NA,"1","77",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"<p>1 climate change, more review, not AM</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\QUHY7EBJ\Abelson - 2020 - Are we sacrificing the future of coral reefs on th.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"Browman, Howard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic and Marine","<p>1 climate change, more review, not AM</p>"

The introduction and dissemination of this pathogen is attributed to the spread of invasive North American crayfish, which can act as carriers for               A. astaci               . As native European crayfish often succumb to infection with               A. astaci               , determining the prevalence of this pathogen in non-native crayfish is vital to prioritize native crayfish populations for managed translocation. In the current study, 23 populations of invasive signal crayfish (               Pacifastacus leniusculus               ) from the UK were tested for               A. astaci               presence using quantitative PCR. Altogether, 13 out of 23 (56¬∑5%) populations were found to be infected, and pathogen prevalence within infected sites varied from 3 to 80%. Microsatellite pathogen genotyping revealed that at least one UK signal crayfish population was infected with the               A. astaci               genotype group B, known to include virulent strains. Based on recent crayfish distribution records and the average rate of signal crayfish population dispersal, we identified one native white-clawed crayfish (               Austropotamobius pallipes               ) population predicted to come into contact with infected signal crayfish within 5 years. This population should be considered as a priority for translocation.","2017-04","2020-08-19 01:25:12","2020-08-19 01:25:43","2020-08-19 01:25:12","411-418",NA,"4","144",NA,"Parasitology","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"0","<p>1 crayfish pathogen invasion</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\LIQPHSUI\James et al. - 2017 - The prevalence of Aphanomyces astaci in inv.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic and Marine","<p>1 crayfish pathogen invasion</p>"

On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), an approximately 51% decline in coral cover occurred over the period 1985‚Äì2012. We conducted a gene-by-environment association analysis across 12¬∞ latitude on the GBR, as well as both in situ and laboratory genotype-by-phenotype association analyses. These analyses allowed us to identify alleles at two genetic loci that account for differences in environmental stress tolerance and antioxidant capacity in the common coral               Acropora millepora               . The effect size for antioxidant capacity was considerable and biologically relevant (32.5 and 14.6% for the two loci). Antioxidant capacity is a critical component of stress tolerance because a multitude of environmental stressors cause increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Our findings provide the first step toward the development of novel coral reef management approaches, such as spatial mapping of stress tolerance for use in marine protected area design, identification of stress-tolerant colonies for assisted migration, and marker-assisted selective breeding to create more tolerant genotypes for restoration of denuded reefs.","2016-05","2020-08-19 01:25:31","2020-08-19 01:25:31","2020-08-19 01:25:31","e1500842",NA,"5","2",NA,"Sci.

Human-induced disturbance or anthropogenic activities, including hydrological alteration, introduction of exotic species, intensive aquaculture industry, water pollution, rapid sedimentation, natural disturbance (climate change and drought) and also limited distribution, have forced Aphanius farsicus populations to the edge of extinction. Aphanius farsicus can benefit from a combination of reintroduction, assisted colonization and capture release which potentially increase success rate of a conservation management plan.

While the ecology of the New Zealand Placostylus species is generally well known, having been studied for more than 20 years, and there is some published information on the one species of Placostylus from Lord Howe Island, there is very little published information on the six New Caledonian species. These New Caledonian taxa are all endangered, but their conservation is hampered by a lack of information about the life-history, biology and ecology especially relating to Placostylus bondeensis, P. eddystonensis, P. scarabus and P. caledonicus. The data that is available comes mostly from studies on the two remaining species - P. fibratus and P. porphyrostomus. Here we review what is known of the activity patterns, growth rates, life-histories, habitat use, nutrition, movement patterns and causes of population decline in these two species and collate the available information from the limited and mostly unpublished literature. The two species are threatened in different ways Placostylus fibratus is favoured as food, and as a result, has been over-collected from the wild, while P. porphyrostomus is threatened by habitat modification and destruction, and by predation by introduced rodents. We make several recommendations for the conservation of New Caledonian Placostylus which ultimately may depend on the work we describe here on captive breeding and management. Translocations to predator-free sanctuaries coupled with augmentation of existing populations may be necessary to maintain populations of these species in the wild.","2008","2021-01-25 17:36:00","2021-01-25 17:36:00","","13",NA,"","28",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zotero",NA,NA,"<p>1 - review but not relevant</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\ADWCI7ZT\Brescia et al. - 2008 - A review of the ecology and conservation of Placos.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic and Marine","<p>1 - review but not relevant</p>"

Seed source populations were sampled over a temperature gradient of 2¬∞C, located up to 120km from the receiving site. Two receiving-site management treatments were applied: hand removal of exotic species, and exclusion of macropod grazing and trampling. There were no effects of weeding the receiving grassland and we concluded the low fertility of the site provided protection from exotic competition. After eight growing seasons, protection from grazing resulted in double to triple the numbers of established plants, depending on the species. Amongst populations within a species, larger seeds and early emergence reflected later establishment success for Bulbine only. At the species level, early performance was not indicative of later numbers of reproductive plants established. We found no long-term evidence of home-site advantage in any species, and no apparent disadvantage of non-matching lithology. All source populations were represented at the end of the experiment (Season 6). Counts after eight seasons‚Äô growth indicated a continuing trend of population increase in all three species. The persistence of all populations suggests that admixture or climate-adjusted provenancing may be a realistic option to restore depleted populations of herbaceous plants in grassy eucalypt woodlands in a warming climate.","2018","2020-08-14 17:30:46","2020-08-14 17:30:46","2020-08-14 17:30:46","628",NA,"8","66",NA,"Aust.

This prediction, as well as many sustainable management and conservation practices, assumes that species are adapted to their current climate. However, this assumption is rarely tested. Using a large-scale common garden experiment combined with genome-wide sequencing, we found that valley oak (               Quercus lobata               ), a foundational tree species in California ecosystems, showed a signature of adaptational lag to temperature, with fastest growth rates occurring at cooler temperatures than populations are currently experiencing. Future warming under realistic emissions scenarios was predicted to lead to further maladaptation to temperature and reduction in growth rates for valley oak. We then identified genotypes predicted to grow relatively fast under warmer temperatures and demonstrated that selecting seed sources based on their genotype has the potential to mitigate predicted negative consequences of future climate warming on growth rates in valley oak. These results illustrate that the belief of local adaptation underlying many management and conservation practices, such as using local seed sources for restoration, may not hold for some species. If contemporary adaptational lag is commonplace, we will need new approaches to help alleviate predicted negative consequences of climate warming on natural systems. We present one such approach, ‚Äúgenome-informed assisted gene flow,‚Äù which optimally matches individuals to future climates based on genotype‚Äìphenotype‚Äìenvironment associations.","2019-12-10","2020-08-14 17:31:18","2020-08-18 03:38:39","2020-08-14 17:31:18","25179-25185",NA,"50","116",NA,"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>3a - genomic - trait - association</p> <p>¬†</p> <p>¬†</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/BV864FL8/Browne et al. - 2019 - Adaptational lag to temperature in valley oak ( i.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3a - genomic - trait - association</p> <p>¬†</p> <p>¬†</p>"

In response to this looming crisis, the calls for the translocation, or assisted migration, of species to ensure the survival of this biodiversity have been increasing. The concept has its detractors, and is not without risk, but few studies have documented the success of the approach or veracity of the risk. Here we review both the ecological restoration literature and the plant reintroduction literature to discover insights into the promises and pitfalls of translocating species as an adaptation strategy in the face of our changing climate. Although habitat restoration and the assisted migration of rare plant species have different objectives and goals, they share the practice of translocating species from their site of origin to a new one. It is primarily the scale at which the movement of those species occurs that distinguishes the two.","2016-02-06","2020-08-14 17:31:38","2020-08-14 17:31:38","2020-08-14 17:31:38","250-261",NA,"4","63",NA,"","Assisted migration as a climate change adaptation strategy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

The study considers provenance variation of 120 parent trees from 13 seed sources planted at five test sites in the Pacific Northwest. The unique, long-term nature of the study makes it valuable to revisit and consider its biological and historical significance. This analysis considers how far climatically Douglas-fir populations may be moved without incurring unacceptable declines in growth and survival. Results indicate that Douglas-fir seed sources may be moved at least 2¬∞ C cooler or warmer and still retain good long-term survival and productivity. However, projected future climate change beyond 2¬∞ C may lead to lower survival and productivity. One option to address these concerns is assisted migration; however, if seed sources are moved beyond 2‚Äì3¬∞ C to a cooler climate in anticipation of warming, or from a more continental to a maritime climate, we are likely to see increased mortality and associated losses in productivity in the near-term. Lessons from this study include: (1) pay attention to good experimental design; we were able to overcome limitations from the design by using new statistical approaches; (2) maladaptation may take time to develop; poorer survival was not evident until more than two decades after planting; and (3) long-term studies may have value for addressing new, unforeseen issues in the future.","2020-01-07","2020-08-14 17:36:30","2020-08-14 17:36:30","2020-08-14 17:36:30","1-13",NA,"1","118",NA,"","The 1912 Douglas-Fir Heredity Study",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>3b?</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/87ADQ7ZW/St. Clair et al. - 2020 - The 1912 Douglas-Fir Heredity Study Long-Term Eff.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b?</p>"

These include the physiological adaptations of the host tree (N uptake capacities among populations), matched to the particular amount and nature of soil N supply (organic N, NH               4               +               , and NO               3               ‚Äì               ), as mediated by communities of site-adapted ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. The spatial attributes of an N economy may vary considerably over the ranges of tree species because of wide gradients in climate and soil fertility, underpinning a potentially important aspect of conifer genecology with implications for climate change mitigation. The evidence for an intersection of N supply with host demand, as mediated by EM fungi, will be briefly reviewed and then evaluated in light of assisted migration studies involving provenance trials of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) in southwestern British Columbia. The trials were established across a wide range of site types, and so they provide valuable data on host response to gradations in soil N supply and interactions with local EM fungal communities. Preliminary results and knowledge gaps will be discussed under the framework of an N economy and management of forest genetic resources.","2014-06","2020-08-14 17:45:58","2020-08-18 03:38:40","2020-08-14 17:45:58","417-423",NA,"6","92",NA,"Botany","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"00000","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>"

Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) and white pine (Pinus strobus L.) seed sources across a study area centred on Ontario, Canada. The model accounts for climate change through the use of universal response functions, which (in principle) predict the growth of any seed source under any climatic conditions. We demonstrated the use of the model for two locations in northern Ontario; both species exhibited significant variation in NPV across the study area and significant gains associated with climate-smart seed movements. For example, the NPV associated with potential white pine seed sources varied by more than $1500¬∑ha               ‚àí1               for a planting site at North Bay, Ontario. We also compared the NPV maps with climate similarity maps to examine the degree to which simple climate matching can act as a proxy for the detailed genecology relationships contained in the universal response functions. Overall, the climate similarity maps were well-correlated with the NPV maps; however, there was poor agreement regarding white pine seed deployment from North Bay, for which the two approaches identified opposite seed transfer directions. We propose that this situation can arise when species show strong adaptation to a central climatic optimum.","2015-10","2020-08-14 17:46:01","2020-08-15 18:21:04","2020-08-14 17:46:01","1248-1257",NA,"10","45",NA,"Can.

Open pollinated seeds from fifteen A. religiosa populations were collected along an elevational gradient (2850-3550 masl; one sampled population every 50 m of elevational difference). Seedlings were evaluated in a common garden test over a period of 30 months. We found significant differences (P < 0.03) among populations in total elongation, final height, date of growth cessation, foliage, stem and total dry weight, as well as frost damage. These differences were strongly associated with the Mean Temperature of the Coldest Month (MTCM; r               2               = 0.6222, P = 0.0005). Seedlings originating from lower elevation populations grew more but suffered more frost damage than those from higher elevations. Populations differentiate genetically when they are separated by 364 m in elevation. Such differentiation was used to delineate three elevational/climatic zones for seed collection, with limits defined at: 2650 masl or 9.7 ¬∞C of MTCM; 3000 masl or 8.5 ¬∞C; 3350 masl or 7.3 ¬∞C; and 3700 masl or 6.1 ¬∞C. Zonification for seedling deployment aiming to match a suitable climate in year 2030 (after projections using an ensemble of 18 General Circulation Models and a Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 watts/ m               2               ), would have the same MTCM zone limits, but shifted 350 m upwards in elevation. This shift would exceed the highest elevations within the MBBR, necessitating the establishment of A. religiosa stands outside the MBBR, to serve as potential future overwintering sites.","2017-12-28","2020-08-14 18:22:24","2020-08-15 18:20:55","2020-08-14 18:22:24","14-23",NA,"1","66",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"00000","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/J5X2VQCJ/Ortiz-Bibian et al. - 2017 - Genetic Variation in Abies religiosa for Quantitat.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>"

Para el manejo de ecosistemas es necesario cuantificar los efectos de estos cambios para planear estrategias de establecimiento de poblaciones viables. Se evalu√≥ la supervivencia y crecimiento de familias de Albizia plurijuga y Ceiba aesculifolia en un gradiente altitudinal y en dos laderas en la ciudad de Morelia, Michoac√°n, que sufre el efecto de isla urbana de calor. La supervivencia de A. plurijuga vari√≥ de forma significativa en funci√≥n de la altitud sobre el nivel del mar, siendo menor a menor altitud (34% a 2050 msnm), y la altura de las plantas tambi√©n fue diferente en cuanto a la altitud. Para Ceiba aesculifolia no hubo diferencias significativas al finalizar el experimento en cuanto a supervivencia a diferentes altitudes, pero s√≠ entre laderas (noroeste 55%, sur 27%). La variable de crecimiento que mostr√≥ diferencias significativas fue el di√°metro del tallo tanto entre laderas (NO = 0,7 cm; S = 0,5 cm) como a diferentes altitudes.

However, such information is not available for most plant species. Here, based on 69 provenances tested at 19 common garden experimental sites, we developed a universal response function (URF) for tree height at seven years of age for the important and wide-spread native Chinese tree species Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco. URF was recently used to predict the potential growth response of a population originating from any climate and growing in any climate conditions. The developed model integrated both genetic and environmental effects, and explained 55% of the total variation in tree height observed among provenances and test sites in China. We found that local provenances performed better than non-local counterparts in habitats located in central, eastern, and southwestern China, showing the evidence of local adaptation as compared to other regions. In contrast, non-local provenances outperformed local ones in peripheral areas in northern and northwestern China, suggesting an adaptational lag in these areas. Future projections suggest that the suitable habitat areas of P. orientalis would expand by 15%‚Äì39% and shift northward by 0.8‚Äì3 degrees in latitude; however, the projected tree height of this species would decline by 4%‚Äì8% if local provenances were used. If optimal provenances were used, tree height growth could be improved by 13%‚Äì15%, along with 59%‚Äì71% suitable habitat expansion. Thus, assisted migration with properly selected seed sources would be effective in avoiding maladaptation in new plantations under a changing climate for P. orientalis.","2019-07-25","2020-08-14 18:27:14","2020-08-18 03:38:40","2020-08-14 18:27:14","622",NA,"8","10",NA,"Forests","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/W3ZAKU5I/Hu et al. - 2019 - Local Adaptation and Response of Platycladus orien.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>"

The main objective of this study was to examine the possibility of selecting superior jack pine provenances based on selected WQA. Twenty-two provenances of jack pine were planted in 1964 in Petawawa Research Forest, ON, Canada, as part of a provenance test. The plantation location offers conditions close to optimum for jack pine growth. Transition ages at breast height, determined with tracheids length, were computed with a piecewise model. Measurements at age 42 from seed were subjected to analyses of variance. Radial variations from pith to bark, as well as trends with seed sources origin of the selected WQA were also considered. A ranking was made based on a selection index built with four WQA. The provenances matured between 8 and 14 years, corresponding to 17%‚Äì48% of juvenile wood proportion. Significant differences among provenances were observed for ring width, ring density, tracheid length, and diameter at breast height but not for tracheid diameter, tree height, transition age, and juvenile wood proportion. None of the provenances ranked the best with all the selected WQA, but it was possible to find provenances exhibiting both high growth rate and good wood quality. A surprising result of this study was that tracheid diameter initially enlarged for 8 years, before declining toward the bark. It is possible to select provenances for a higher growth rate and for good physical (i.e., related to wood density) and anatomical (i.e., related to tracheid dimensions) wood quality attributes.","2019-11-05","2020-08-14 18:27:18","2020-08-14 18:27:18","2020-08-14 18:27:18","985",NA,"11","10",NA,"Forests","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/76LZJDAI/Mvolo et al. - 2019 - Effect of Seed Transfer on Selected Wood Quality A.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p> <p>¬†</p>"

Tree species living in rapidly changing climate conditions are exposed to danger and must adapt to new climate conditions to survive. Trees respond to changes in the environment in numerous ways. Physiological modulation at the seed stage, germination strategy and further development are influenced by many different factors. We review forest abiotic threats (such as drought and heat), including biochemical responses of plants to stress, and biotic threats (pathogens and insects) related to global warming. We then discus the varied adaptations of tree species to changing climate conditions such as seed resistance to environmental stress, improved by an increase in temperature, affinity to specific fungal symbionts, a wide range of tolerance to abiotic environmental conditions in the offspring of populations occurring in continental climate, and germination strategies closely linked to the ecological niche of the species. The existing studies do not clearly indicate whether tree adaptations are shaped by epigenetics or phenology and do not define the role of phenotypic plasticity in tree development. We have created a juxtaposition of literature that is useful in identifying the factors that play key roles in these processes. We compare scientific evidence that species distribution and survival are possible due to phenotypic plasticity and thermal memory with studies that testify that trees‚Äô phenology depends on phylogenesis, but this issue is still open. It is possible that studies in the near future will bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms through which trees adapt to stressful conditions, especially in the context of epigenetic memory in long-lived organisms, and allow us to minimize the harmful effects of climatic events by predicting tree species‚Äô responses or by developing solutions such as assisted migration to mitigate the consequences of these phenomena.","2020-01-21","2020-08-14 18:27:26","2020-08-18 03:38:40","2020-08-14 18:27:26","123",NA,"2","11",NA,"Forests","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/HAAYRF6U/Kijowska-Oberc et al. - 2020 - Adaptation of Forest Trees to Rapidly Changing Cli.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

Human-assisted migration has been proposed as a potential management option to maintain optimal health and productivity of Canada's forests; however, a better understanding of the ecological implications is needed to inform decision-making on assisted migration (AM). This paper examines the ecological constraints and consequences of AM, and discusses options for their mitigation at three scales: translocation over long distances (assisted long-distance migration), translocation just beyond the range limit (assisted range expansion), and translocation of genotypes within the existing range (assisted population migration). From an ecological perspective, we find that AM is a feasible management option for tree species and that constraints and consequences can be minimized through careful application of available knowledge and tools.","2011-12","2020-08-14 18:32:21","2020-08-14 18:32:21","2020-08-14 18:32:21","731-744",NA,"06","87",NA,"The Forestry Chronicle","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

Chihuahua spruce is only found in the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), Mexico. About 42,600 individuals are distributed in forty populations. These populations are fragmented and can be classified into three geographically distinct clusters in the SMO. The total area covered by                 P. chihuahuana                 populations is less than 300 ha. A recent study suggested assisted migration as an alternative to the                 ex situ                 conservation of                 P. chihuahuana                 , taking into consideration the genetic structure and diversity of the populations and the predictions regarding the future climate of the habitat. However, detailed background information is required to enable development of plans for protecting and conserving species and for successful assisted migration. Thus, it is important to identify differences between populations in relation to environmental conditions. The genetic diversity of populations, which affect vigor, evolution and adaptability of the species, must also be considered. In this study, we examined 14 populations of                 P                 .                 chihuahuana                 , with the overall aim of discriminating the populations and form clusters of this species.                                                        Methods                                Each population was represented by one 50¬†√ó¬†50¬†m plot established in the center of its respective location. Climate, soil, dasometric, density variables and genetic and species diversities were assessed in these plots for further analyses. The putatively neutral and adaptive AFLP markers were used to calculate genetic diversity. Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering technique and                 k                 -means clustering algorithm were used to classify the populations in the optimal number of clusters. Later stepwise binomial logistic regression was applied to test for significant differences in variables of the southern and northern                 P. chihuahuana                 populations. Spearman‚Äôs correlation test was used to analyze the relationships among all variables studied.                                                        Results                                The binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that seven climate variables, the geographical longitude and sand proportion in the soil separated the southern from northern populations. The northern populations grow in more arid and continental conditions and on soils with lower sand proportion. The mean genetic diversity using all AFLP studied of                 P. chihuahuana                 was significantly correlated with the mean temperature in the warmest month, where warmer temperatures are associated to larger genetic diversity. Genetic diversity of                 P. chihuahuana                 calculated with putatively adaptive AFLP was not statistically significantly correlated with any environmental factor.                                                        Discussion                                Future reforestation programs should take into account that at least two different groups (the northern and southern cluster) of                 P. chihuahuana                 exist, as local adaptation takes place because of different environmental conditions.","2017-06-12","2020-08-14 18:33:04","2020-08-14 18:33:04","2020-08-14 18:33:04","e3452",NA,"","5",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>3a - genetic - no trait - association</p> <p>¬†</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/SSWRGRSB/Dominguez-Guerrero et al. - 2017 - Discrimination of Picea chihuahuana Martine.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3a - genetic - no trait - association</p> <p>¬†</p>"

We compared the responses of two broadleaved tree species (               Fagus sylvatica               and               Quercus petraea               ) and two conifer tree species (               Pinus sylvestris               and               Picea abies               ) to climatic transfers by fitting models containing the same climatic variables. We used published data from European provenance test networks to model the responses of individual populations nested within species. A mixed model approach was applied to develop a response function for tree height over climatic transfer distance, taking into account the climatic conditions at both the seed source and the test location. The two broadleaved species had flat climatic response curves, indicating high levels of plasticity in populations, facilitating adaptation to a broader range of environments, and conferring a high potential for resilience in the face of climatic change. By contrast, the two conifer species had response curves with more pronounced slopes, indicating a lower resilience to climate change. This finding may reflect stronger genetic clines in               P. sylvestris               and               P. abies,               which constrain their climate responses to narrower climatic ranges. The response functions had maxima that deviated from the expected maximum productivity in the climate of provenance towards cooler/moister climate conditions, which we interpreted as an adaptation lag. Unilateral, linear regression analyses following transfer to warmer and drier sites confirmed a decline in productivity, predictive of the likely impact of ongoing climate change on forest populations. The responses to mimicked climate change evaluated here are of considerable interest for forestry and ecology, supporting projections of expected performance based on ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù field data.","2019-01-15","2020-08-14 18:33:09","2020-08-14 18:33:09","2020-08-14 18:33:09","e6213",NA,"","7",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"","<p>3b</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/6443Q5BL/S√°enz-Romero et al. - 2019 - Common garden comparisons confirm inherited differ.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

"2ISW5VCI","journalArticle",2014,"Soto-Correa, Jos√© C; Lindig-Cisneros, Roberto","Lupinus elegans KUNTH ASSISTED MIGRATION IN COMMON GARDEN FIELD TESTS","","","","","","Lupinus elegans is a species used in ecological restoration and agroforestry programs, because it is tolerant to stress and fixes nitrogen. Genetic variation in quantitative traits was studied in six populations of L. elegans collected along an altitudinal gradient (2312 to 2885 m) in the Mil Cumbres region, east-central Michoac√°n state, M√©xico. Provenance tests were planted at 2600 and 2800 m altitude in two common garden field trials. Tests aimed to evaluate the performance at a different altitude than the site of the seed source, simulating an altitudinalassisted migration. Survival, plant height growth and aerial biomass were measured. For each provenance and experimental sites, climatic variables were estimated for contemporary climate (average 19611990) and future climate (decade centered in 2030, by averaging six model scenarios). It was estimated that by the year 2030 there will be, on average, an increment of 1.4 ¬∞C in mean annual temperature, an increase of 518 degree-days > 5 ¬∞C (DD5), a 90 mm decrease in mean annual precipitation (MAP) (-7.3 % of contemporary MAP), and a 0.0077 increase in an aridity index (DD50.5/MAP). An ANOVA for each site revealed that in the higher altitude site (2800 m) populations exhibited a pronounced pattern of genetic differentiation (P = 0.0001), in which plant height and biomass are associated with the transfer distance between their place of origin and the experimental site. This distance can be expressed in difference in altitude, mean annual temperature, or aridity index. At the site at higher altitude, plants originated from populations growing at higher altitudes were taller and had more biomass than those originated grown at lower altitudes (R2 ‚â• 0.85, P ‚â§ 0.0302). In contrast, in the lower altitude site (2600 m), although there were nearly significant differences (P ‚â§ 0.0615) between populations for all of the variables, there was no clinal pattern. In general, the populations grew less when they were moved away from their original climate: those from the higher altitudes grew less in the 2600 m site, and those from the lower altitudes grew less in the 2800 m site. This indicates that climate change will likely induce less growth in several populations, thus it is recommended to promote gradual assisted migration.","2014","2021-01-25 15:08:05","2021-01-25 15:08:05","","10",NA,"","37",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zotero",NA,"","<p>3b</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/3YEHJXGC/Soto-Correa and Lindig-Cisneros - 2014 - Lupinus elegans KUNTH ASSISTED MIGRATION IN COMMON.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p>"

In this study, we examined the potential effect of assisted migration of tree seed on time to bud flush for white spruce. Flushing times of seedlings from 23 white spruce provenances from Ontario were observed under varying temperature conditions simulated in controlled environment chambers. Results indicated that time to bud flush varied considerably among provenances. Although higher temperatures significantly promoted bud flushing for all provenances, provenance-by-temperature interactions were negligible, indicating stable performance of white spruce provenances for this adaptive trait. Spatial patterns of variation among provenances in bud flushing were not consistent with patterns found in range-wide provenance tests. Assisted migration of tree seed across relatively short distances is unlikely to delay bud flushing time in white spruce. Some southern populations may flush earlier at more northerly sites, which would exacerbate spring frost risk. Tree improvement may be an effective approach to utilize among- and withinprovenance variation to enhance this fitness trait for better climatic adaptation.","2011","2021-01-25 15:43:54","2021-01-25 15:43:54","","7",NA,"3","87",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zotero",NA,"","<p>3b</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/PGY3DD46/Lu and Man - 2011 - Assessment of assisted migration effects on spring.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p>"

Con la finalidad de generar informaci√≥n que permita planear la cantidad de semilla necesaria a recolectar para realizar programas de reforestaci√≥n a gran escala en la regi√≥n de la Reserva de la Bi√≥sfera de la Mariposa Monarca, se evalu√≥ la viabilidad y germinaci√≥n de semilla de oyamel recolectada en 15 poblaciones a lo largo de un gradiente altitudinal (2850 a 3550 msnm, una cada 50 m) en el cerro de San Andr√©s, Michoac√°n. Hubo diferencias estad√≠sticamente significativas entre poblaciones en viabilidad (P = 0.0007) y germinaci√≥n (P < 0.0001) de las semillas. Se encontr√≥ una relaci√≥n cuadr√°tica significativa de la viabilidad (R¬≤ = 0.510, P = 0.0138) y la germinaci√≥n (R¬≤ = 0.768, P = 0.0002) con la altitud de origen de la procedencia.

Si se recolecta de la zona de altitud intermedia (Zona II, de 3000 a 3350 msnm) se requerir√° recolectar aproximadamente 2.0 kg de semilla para producir 10,000 plantas en vivero; en cambio, la misma meta requerir√≠a de cinco veces m√°s semilla de la zona de menor altitud (11.1 kg, Zona I, 2650 a 3000 msnm).

The tree also grows only in the southern part of Korea because it is susceptible to cold. Recently climate changes have had widespread impacts on forest trees. Thus, the use of good quality seeds is prerequisite for assessing assisted migration adaptation trial. In this study, we conducted to investigate its cone and seed characteristics of each family, which is expected to improve seeds productivity for planting valuable timber trees. A total of 14 families were selected from the experimental forest in Boseong, Jeonnam province in 1981. The seed production capacity was estimated to range from 87.2 to 129.4 among families and the average was 111.3. The number of aborted ovules was investigated in the range of 11.4 to 29.5 for the first test and 7.4 to 22.2 for the second test. The average number of empty and filled seeds was 1.4 and 79.2 per cone, respectively. Based on the results, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between the number of fertile scale and the seed production ability.","2018-02-28","2021-01-25 18:18:31","2021-01-25 18:18:31","2021-01-25 18:18:31","82-86",NA,"1","34",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (CSL JSON)",NA,"","<p>3b</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/4VUBR3WE/Lee et al. - 2018 - Variation in Seed and Cone Characteristics of Lobl.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","<p>3b</p>"

The species is threatened with extinction because of its small number of individuals and the impediments to its reproduction (a combination of protogyny, a short period of stigma receptivity, and a lack of efficient pollinators). To reduce the risk of extinction we conducted two conservation translocation trials: one to augment the sole extant population, and the other 202 km north of the current range. The latter trial was a conservation introduction in which the goals were to increase the population and to buffer against the effects of climate change. We used emerged and grafted seedlings as translocation materials. We compared the survival, growth, and eco-physiological properties of emerged and grafted seedlings at the two sites. The survival rate and growth were higher for grafted seedlings than for emerged seedlings at both sites. Eco-physiological data indicated that grafted seedlings at both sites were as efficient or more so in light and water usage than wild individuals, whereas emerged seedlings were less efficient. Grafted seedlings attained the flowering stage sooner than emerged seedlings. Our study suggests that grafting can facilitate the augmentation and establishment of new populations of               M. longipedunculata               and perhaps of new populations of other threatened species facing reproductive difficulties and climate change.","2016-07","8/14/2020 17:29","8/14/2020 17:29","8/14/2020 17:29","437-445",NA,"3","50",NA,"Oryx","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\KWUPIMXH\Ren et al. - 2016 - The use of grafted seedlings increases the success.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants",NA

Twelve locations with populations of               T. magnifica               have been identified (1 extinct, 11 extant).               T. magnifica               only grows in the surface soil on stone walls or rocks under the canopy of secondary forests and plantations and has no specific associated plant species. Canopy closure, soil water content and the distance to the closest stream are the main factors influencing the distribution of               T. magnifica               . We reintroduced               T. magnifica               plantlets produced by tissue culture into three locations: one within the species' original range, and 11.5 and 400 km from the species' original range. After 11 months survival rate was 40‚Äì58% but survival was higher and plantlet crowns were larger at the location within the species' original range than at the other two sites. The combination of advanced propagation techniques and ecological restoration could facilitate reintroduction and conservation of               T. magnifica               and other rare and threatened plants. This example of the successful reintroduction of a rare, threatened herb has implications for human-assisted migration and colonization of rare plant species under future climate change scenarios.","2012-07","8/14/2020 17:28","8/14/2020 17:28","8/14/2020 17:28","391-398",NA,"3","46",NA,"Oryx","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"1","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\L53WQZUS\Ren et al. - 2012 - Reintroduction of Tigridiopalma magnifica ,.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

Using long-term observational studies in the field and common garden and greenhouse experiments of a foundation tree species (               Pinus edulis               ) and its mutualistic ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) associates, we show that EMF community composition is under strong plant genetic control. Seedlings acquire the EMF community of their seed source trees (drought tolerant vs. drought intolerant), even when exposed to inoculum from the alternate tree type. Drought-tolerant trees had 25% higher growth and a third the mortality of drought-intolerant trees over the course of 10 y of drought in the wild, traits that were also observed in their seedlings in a common garden. Inoculation experiments show that EMF communities are critical to drought tolerance. Drought-tolerant and drought-intolerant seedlings grew similarly when provided sterile EMF inoculum, but drought-tolerant seedlings grew 25% larger than drought-intolerant seedlings under dry conditions when each seedling type developed its distinct EMF community. This demonstration that particular combinations of plant genotype and mutualistic EMF communities improve the survival and growth of trees with drought is especially important, given the vulnerability of forests around the world to the warming and drying conditions predicted for the future.","10/17/2017","8/14/2020 17:31","8/18/2020 3:38","8/14/2020 17:31","11169-11174",NA,"42","114",NA,"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\GXY9325R\Gehring et al. - 2017 - Tree genetics defines fungal partner communities t.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants",NA

Temperate tree species may have a competitive advantage in this region as the climate warms. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of northern forests requires a multifaceted approach, one that involves cooperative relations given the region‚Äôs complex ownership patterns. In this context, a nongovernment conservation organization and public land-management agencies are partnering to test climate-informed forest management approaches, including: (1) Resilience, targeting northern conifer planting at ‚Äúclimate-resilient sites‚Äù with suitable microclimates to sustain boreal species over time; (2) Transition, catalyzing the shift to a temperate forest matrix using within-range plantings of native, climate-adapted tree species. Deployed together, Resilience and Transition strategies can help the Northwoods shift towards future forest conditions. Results from this work will help land managers make informed decisions about forest management and enhance landscape resilience in a changing climate.","5/5/2020","8/14/2020 17:36","8/14/2020 17:36","8/14/2020 17:36","219-232",NA,"3","118",NA,"","Partnerships to Take on Climate Change",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"1","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

This research examines the variation in perceived acceptability of potential forest management interventions that can mitigate the risks of climate change among rural forest-based communities in British Columbia and Alberta. In each of the four study communities, three focus groups composed of foresters, environmentalists, and local citizens were consulted. A Q-sort exercise was utilized to measure the perceived acceptance of a set of nine forest adaptation management scenarios that represented a spectrum of human interventions in forested ecosystems. The theory of Cultural Cognition of Risk was applied as a theoretical framework to analyze the way in which participants perceived adaptation strategies. Results indicate that foresters perceived the strategies based on assisted migration as being relatively less acceptable compared with the other social groups, while environmentalists prioritized adaptation strategies that featured mixed species, and local citizens perceived all of the adaptation strategies more neutrally. Cultural Cognition of Risk theory was determined to play a role in shaping perceptions of the adaptation strategies in that individualists tended to accept the local-based strategies while opposing the assisted migration based strategies. Conversely, hierarchists perceived assisted migration based strategies more favourably than the other cultural groups.","2019-05","8/14/2020 17:46","8/14/2020 17:46","8/14/2020 17:46","553-564",NA,"5","49",NA,"Can.

The opinions of leaders of forest-dependent communities were also sought to evaluate how well they align with those of the public at large. Results show that the views of the general public and community leaders correspond. There is a low acceptance for a ‚Äúdo-nothing‚Äù strategy that allows climate change to run its course without any human intervention; high acceptance of replanting with local seeds; a decreasing acceptance of strategies that involve more manipulation such as breeding, using nonlocal seeds, and moving seeds outside of a species‚Äô natural range; and a low acceptance of genetically engineered solutions. However, a high proportion of respondents changed their answers when told that a particular strategy would lead to either favourable or unfavourable outcomes related to socioeconomics of forest-dependent communities, forest aesthetics, and pest, disease, and fire outbreaks. We conclude that a meaningful and participatory dialogue on forest adaptation strategies in the face of climate change can only emerge if residents and other interested stakeholders have an adequate understanding of current forest management practices, proposed reforestation strategies, the role of technological interventions, and the values and services for which western Canada‚Äôs forests are to be managed.","2014-12","8/14/2020 17:45","8/18/2020 3:38","8/14/2020 17:45","1525-1533",NA,"12","44",NA,"Can.

Data indicate that the breeding system of the species is facultative xenogamy with spontaneous autogamy playing a minor role in fruit development. Stigma‚Äìanther distance was correlated with style length. Species of microlepidoptera were the most frequent floral visitors, and are possibly important pollinator taxa. Variation in flower, fruit, and seed morphology, as well as seed germination was significant among populations from the islands. The time each island has been available for colonization‚Äìevolution, as well as bird-assisted colonization of the Azores archipelago through transport of seeds from the South, likely play a role in floral and other characteristics of V. cylindraceum populations.

Recently, Turkish hazel has been found only in small isolated populations, and very small populations within its natural distribution area, so it has been protected under IUCN with the status ""Least Concern (LC)"". Therefore, the remaining Turkish hazel populations have a critical importance. Genetic conservation of this tree species plays a key role in sustainable forest development. There have been only a few studies of single populations, but an overview including all countries is still missing. The aim of this publication is to give an overview of ecological and economic importance of Turkish hazel, which is considered as a tolerant tree species to climate change, for dry and warm conditions in Central Europe.               Materials and Methods:               This review paper has been prepared based on the existing literature such as reports, theses, project documents and publications related to Turkish hazel. This paper applies a literature review of the concepts of: i) Distribution and threats of Turkish hazel, ii) Ecological and economic importance, iii) Regeneration, soil demand and shading tolerance, iv) Seed, seedling, plant production and planting, v) Competitiveness in forest communities, vi) Invasiveness and hybridization, and vii) Future stand mixtures.               Results and Conclusions:               This review paper should interest forest practitioners and scientists in all countries who work with this important and valuable tree species under climate change. At first, an inventory of all populations in each country is needed. For this purpose, research should focus on the cultivation of convenient provenances of Turkish hazel under climate change. Next, genetic differences should be determined in the laboratory using genetic markers. After the assessment of the phenotype and genotype of different provenances, it would be possible to recommend provenance for each ecological condition and assisted migration (AM). Main recommendations for each country are used for selecting and establishing gene conservation units (in-situ and ex-situ) and seed orchards that will ensure the survival of Turkish hazel, and for building the base for cultivation in the future. In addition, the results might be a basis for future provenance tests, plantations and possibilities of assisted migration attempts.","3/23/2019","8/14/2020 18:22","8/15/2020 18:20","8/14/2020 18:22","53-63",NA,"1","10",NA,"SEEFOR","A Review on Turkish Hazel ( <i>Corylus colurna</i> L.)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"0","1","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\ZDLNLMD8\≈†eho et al. - 2019 - A Review on Turkish Hazel ( Corylus colurna.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

The establishment success of white pine and red oak was measured with and without tree shelters (to protect from deer). Ecological factors affecting the height growth of the four species were also measured for protected trees. After 6 years, the survival and total height of unprotected oak was 29% and 44.3 cm vs. 80.5% and 138.5 cm for protected oak. White pine was less affected by browsing (survival of 79.5 and 93.5%; height of 138.5 and 217.9 cm for unprotected vs. protected pine). Height of white pine was higher in the grey birch stands, while height of all hardwoods was higher in the white ash stands, which had better soil drainage, higher fertility, and an understory dominated by Rubus species. Total height of all hardwoods was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with Rubus cover and with soil fertility. Pine and walnut height were strongly correlated (p < 0.001) to shelterwood structure (canopy openness or total basal area). Pine was less sensitive to variations in shelterwood characteristics, while black walnut showed high sensitivity. This study provides evidence that underplanting is suitable for black walnut assisted migration northward and for bitternut hickory restoration, despite soil conditions that were less favorable than in bottomland habitats mainly supporting these species in eastern Canada. Tree shelters offering protection from deer browsing and species-specific site selection are recommended for underplanting in the southern Qu√©bec region.","8/16/2018","8/14/2020 18:27","8/14/2020 18:27","8/14/2020 18:27","499",NA,"8","9",NA,"Forests","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"1","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\HH8FB7NG\Truax et al. - 2018 - Ecological Factors Affecting White Pine, Red Oak, .pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

A habitat suitability model, a migration simulation model, and an assessment based on biological and disturbance factors were used with United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to evaluate species potential to migrate or infill naturally into suitable habitats over the next 100 years. We describe a suite of variables, by species, for each unique geographic unit, packaged as summary tables describing current abundance, potential future change in suitable habitat, adaptability, and capability to cope with the changing climate, and colonization likelihood over 100 years. This resulting synthesis and summation effort, culminating over two decades of work, provides a detailed data set that incorporates habitat quality, land cover, and dispersal potential, spatially constrained, for nearly all the tree species of the eastern United States.

When an overtopping plant alters the physiognomy of the existing vegetation (e.g., trees invading a shrubland), ecosystem processes can also be dramatically altered. Worldwide, Monterey pine (               Pinus radiata               ) cultivars have been planted in Mediterranean-like climates and are known to invade surrounding natural communities. Ecological impacts resulting from these invasions have been widely investigated; however, the effects from solitary pine trees on the vegetation they overtop are lacking. Furthermore, studies on the impact of               P. radiata               cultivars from the California floristic province, where               P. radiata               is native, do not exist. In coastal California, north of the present-day range of native               P. radiata               stands, cultivars of this species have invaded northern coastal scrub vegetation. To determine the impact of pine invasion on species richness and structure in this habitat, floristic surveys were conducted in 20 blocks that consisted of invaded and uninvaded plots. An invaded plot contained two subplots located under the canopy of an isolated pine tree, whereas a paired, uninvaded plot contained two subplots located in coastal scrub adjacent to each pine. Pine trees selected ranged in size from 2.8 to 119 cm (1.1 to 46.9 in) basal diameter. Our results demonstrate that understory native cover and species richness are negatively correlated with tree size. Understory exotic plant cover and richness of species other than               P. radiata               did not show any correlation with tree size, mainly because exotic plants had a very low abundance overall.","2013-06","8/14/2020 18:24","8/14/2020 18:24","8/14/2020 18:24","231-242",NA,"2","6",NA,"Invasive plant sci. manag.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"1","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

Fine-scale phylogenetic studies and increasing scrutiny of morphological, ecological, and geographic variation in the CA-FP vascular flora continue to reveal novel, often cryptic diversity warranting taxonomic attention. The prevalence of such discoveries warrants caution about potential for loss of undescribed or unrecognized biodiversity from human-related impacts, including insufficiently informed conservation-related actions (e.g., genetic augmentation or assisted migration). Broader-scale molecular phylogenetic studies have yielded other examples of more extensive CA-FP diversification than previously resolved. For example, clades uniting CA-FP taxa not earlier thought to be such close relatives have been discovered in a wide diversity of tribes of composites and legumes. This understanding adds additional weight to the conclusions of Raven and Axelrod (1978) that in situ evolution, especially since the pronounced mid-Miocene transition toward summer-drying, has been a major factor in the origins of Californian vascular plant diversity. The importance of paleo-endemism in gymnosperms and (especially woody) angiosperms of the CA-FP flora also has been corroborated and refined by molecular phylogenetic studies, with improved understanding of the timing of divergence and relationships of isolated lineages, such as the extinct island-endemic Hesperelaea A. Gray (Oleaceae). On a regional scale, studies of spatial patterns of Californian species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic endemism by the California Plant Phylodiversity Project (CPPP) have reinforced the floristic importance of areas of high topographic complexity, or environmental heterogeneity more generally, where relatively high levels of habitat diversity, speciation, and lineage persistence may be expected. The CPPP‚Äôs finding that particularly young plant lineages and significantly high phylogenetic endemism are concentrated in drier regions of the CA-FP and in the adjacent Californian deserts has corroborated earlier preliminary findings and aligns with Stebbins‚Äôs (1952) hypothesis of aridity as an evolutionary stimulus. A recent conservation gap analysis by the CPPP incorporating flora-wide phylogenetic and geographic occurrence data plus land-protection status and habitat-integrity information for California has demonstrated the potential of an integrative, evolutionary approach for identifying high-priority land conservation targets.","8/28/2019","8/14/2020 18:28","8/14/2020 18:28","8/14/2020 18:28","429-440",NA,"3","104",NA,"annals","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"1","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\7Z462JBV\Baldwin - 2019 - Fine-scale to Flora-wide Phylogenetic Perspectives.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

Projections emphasizing range shifts at continental scale, however, can mask contrasting patterns at local or regional scale where management and policy decisions are made. Moreover, models usually show potential for areas to become climatically unsuitable, remain suitable, or become suitable for a particular species with climate change, but each of these outcomes raises markedly different ecological and management issues. Managing forest decline at sites where climatic stress is projected to increase is likely to be the most immediate challenge resulting from climate change. Here we assess habitat suitability with climate change for five dominant tree species of eastern North American forests, focusing on areas of greatest vulnerability (loss of suitability in the baseline range) in Quebec (Canada) rather than opportunities (increase in suitability). Results show that these species are at risk of maladaptation over a remarkably large proportion of their baseline range. Depending on species, 5‚Äì21% of currently climatically suitable habitats are projected to be at risk of becoming unsuitable. This suggests that species that have traditionally defined whole regional vegetation assemblages could become less adapted to these regions, with significant impact on ecosystems and forest economy. In spite of their well-recognised limitations and the uncertainty that remains, regionally-explicit risk assessment approaches remain one of the best options to convey that message and the need for climate policies and forest management adaptation strategies.","7/13/2016","8/14/2020 18:33","8/14/2020 18:33","8/14/2020 18:33","e2218",NA,"","4",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,"1","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\3IPA6W56\P√©ri√© and de Blois - 2016 - Dominant forest tree species are potentially vulne.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

The spatial distribution of the tree in the administrative Region (Abruzzo) was used to define the ecological traits while three modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, Random Forest) were used to build a Species distribution model according to two climatic scenarios.Main results: The marginal population's range was predicted to shift at higher elevations as consequence of climatic adaptation. Many zones, represented by the higher part of the mountains surrounding the study area (currently bare and inhospitable for trees), were identified as suitable in future for the species. However, in the case of a rapid climate change, this marginal population may not be able to move as fast as necessary. An in-situ adaptive management integrated with an assisted migration protocol might be considered to enforce the natural regeneration and improve the richness and variability of the genetic pool.Research highlights: Most of the genetic richness is held in small populations at the borders of natural distribution of forest species. Monitoring this MAP could be useful to understand the adaptive processes of the species and could support the future management of many other within-core populations.Keywords: Species Distribution Models; Mediterranean forests; Abruzzo; climate change; altitudinal shift.","12/2/2016","8/14/2020 18:32","8/14/2020 18:32","8/14/2020 18:32","e072",NA,"3","25",NA,"Forest Syst","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\8CHVYYTC\Marchi et al. - 2016 - Future scenarios and conservation strategies for a.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants",NA

The study emphasises the complexity of climatic factors and physiological mechanisms, which may potentially endanger the persistence of tree populations and which cannot be reduced to problems of drought and temperature increase. A substantial inter-population variation in traits associated with the response to climatic stress, observed in provenance experiments, is a prerequisite for the choice of proper forest reproductive material (FRM) in reforestation as a strategy of climate-change mitigation. Assisted migration, i.e., transfer of FRM from source regions, currently characterised by such climate characteristics, which are expected in the target regions in the future, requires knowledge of key stress factors (depending on the climate scenario), physiological processes associated with the adaptation to this stress, identification of genes and eventually epigenetic mechanisms, controlling adaptation processes, and finally mapping of genetic and/or epigenetic variation in key genes. For most tree species, such information is not yet available. Therefore, assisted migration under such information uncertainty needs to be complemented by in situ gene conservation measures to preserve the possibility of reversing the effects of eventual erroneous decisions on FRM transfer.","6/1/2015","8/19/2020 1:22","8/19/2020 1:24","8/19/2020 1:22","124-130",NA,"2","61",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"4","1","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\I4M25RHE\G√∂m√∂ry et al. - 2015 - Voƒæba lesn√©ho reprodukƒçn√©ho materi√°lu v podmienkac.pdf",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants","1"

We used empirical demographic analyses to identify factors to enhance population establishment and survival of Chloropyron molle subsp. molle (Orobancaceae), an annual hemiparasite, and to compare reintroduced with natural populations. Twelve years after outplanting, the reintroduced population persists but is in decline; impediments to success include the lack of adaptive management response to weed invasions and muted variance in hydrology. Transplantation of Lilaeopsis masonii (Apiaceae), a rhizomatous perennial herb, failed to meet success criteria for mitigation at local project scale, but dispersal and establishment of metapopulation patches indicated persistence at the landscape scale. This species has been found to be genetically indistinct from a widespread congener, and has few threats to persistence so long as suitable habitat is present. These two examples demonstrate the need for integrated conservation management strategies that prioritize habitat connectivity and maintain physical processes to support dispersal in response to sea level rise. For the hemiparasite, assisted colonization may sustain populations threatened by sea level rise, but only if a strong commitment to effective stewardship is realized.","2013-05","8/19/2020 1:23","8/19/2020 1:26","8/19/2020 1:23","309-318",NA,"5","91",NA,"Botany","Sea change under climate change",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI.org (Crossref)",NA,"4",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants",NA
