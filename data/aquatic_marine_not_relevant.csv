However, climate change is not a sole stressor. Most coral reefs around the world are threatened by a myriad of local stressors, including overfishing, destructive fishing, untreated sewage, agriculture effluents (nutrients and pesticides), and siltation due to deforestation. Reefs will not survive the severe effects of this plethora of stressors while waiting until we mitigate climate change. In order to safeguard reefs, we need to adopt a new narrative—“there are diverse ways in which we can improve the chances of saving coral reefs”—by acting now to: (i) improve their local protection and marine protected area networks, (ii) alleviate their critical local stressors, (iii) restore degraded and damaged reefs, and (iv) promote reef resilience and adaptation (e.g. adaptation networks, assisted evolution) to the changing conditions, notably climate change effects. It is time for us to move on from the impractical goals of the climate change narrative (“interventions beyond our field of expertise”) to building up resilience and adaptation of social-ecological systems of coral reefs.","2020-01-01","2020-08-14 17:36:15","2020-08-14 17:36:15","2020-08-14 17:36:15","40-45","","1","77","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>1 climate change, more review, not AM</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\QUHY7EBJ\Abelson - 2020 - Are we sacrificing the future of coral reefs on th.pdf","","","","Browman, Howard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The introduction and dissemination of this pathogen is attributed to the spread of invasive North American crayfish, which can act as carriers for               A. astaci               . As native European crayfish often succumb to infection with               A. astaci               , determining the prevalence of this pathogen in non-native crayfish is vital to prioritize native crayfish populations for managed translocation. In the current study, 23 populations of invasive signal crayfish (               Pacifastacus leniusculus               ) from the UK were tested for               A. astaci               presence using quantitative PCR. Altogether, 13 out of 23 (56·5%) populations were found to be infected, and pathogen prevalence within infected sites varied from 3 to 80%. Microsatellite pathogen genotyping revealed that at least one UK signal crayfish population was infected with the               A. astaci               genotype group B, known to include virulent strains. Based on recent crayfish distribution records and the average rate of signal crayfish population dispersal, we identified one native white-clawed crayfish (               Austropotamobius pallipes               ) population predicted to come into contact with infected signal crayfish within 5 years. This population should be considered as a priority for translocation.","2017-04","2020-08-19 01:25:12","2020-08-19 01:25:43","2020-08-19 01:25:12","411-418","","4","144","","Parasitology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","00000","<p>1 crayfish pathogen invasion</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\LIQPHSUI\James et al. - 2017 - The prevalence of Aphanomyces astaci in inv.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), an approximately 51% decline in coral cover occurred over the period 1985–2012. We conducted a gene-by-environment association analysis across 12° latitude on the GBR, as well as both in situ and laboratory genotype-by-phenotype association analyses. These analyses allowed us to identify alleles at two genetic loci that account for differences in environmental stress tolerance and antioxidant capacity in the common coral               Acropora millepora               . The effect size for antioxidant capacity was considerable and biologically relevant (32.5 and 14.6% for the two loci). Antioxidant capacity is a critical component of stress tolerance because a multitude of environmental stressors cause increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Our findings provide the first step toward the development of novel coral reef management approaches, such as spatial mapping of stress tolerance for use in marine protected area design, identification of stress-tolerant colonies for assisted migration, and marker-assisted selective breeding to create more tolerant genotypes for restoration of denuded reefs.","2016-05","2020-08-19 01:25:31","2020-08-19 01:25:31","2020-08-19 01:25:31","e1500842","","5","2","","Sci.

Iran and central Anatolia show the highest diversity of Aphanius, and 14 extant (including Aphanius farsicus, an endemic species in the endorheic Lake Maharlu basin, South-western Iran) and one fossil species are known to occur in Iran based on data derived from fish morphometry and meristics, otoliths, scales and mtDNA sequences. Human-induced disturbance or anthropogenic activities, including hydrological alteration, introduction of exotic species, intensive aquaculture industry, water pollution, rapid sedimentation, natural disturbance (climate change and drought) and also limited distribution, have forced Aphanius farsicus populations to the edge of extinction. Aphanius farsicus can benefit from a combination of reintroduction, assisted colonization and capture release which potentially increase success rate of a conservation management plan. Encouraging the local communities, NGOs and media to involve voluntarily in longterm conservation programs is highly recommended.","2016","2020-08-30 19:41:39","2020-08-30 19:46:54","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","00000","<p>1 systematics</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\7NGUXSGE\Esmaeili et al. - 2016 - Review Article Review of Aphanius farsicus a crit.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the ecology of the New Zealand Placostylus species is generally well known, having been studied for more than 20 years, and there is some published information on the one species of Placostylus from Lord Howe Island, there is very little published information on the six New Caledonian species. These New Caledonian taxa are all endangered, but their conservation is hampered by a lack of information about the life-history, biology and ecology especially relating to Placostylus bondeensis, P. eddystonensis, P. scarabus and P. caledonicus. The data that is available comes mostly from studies on the two remaining species - P. fibratus and P. porphyrostomus. Here we review what is known of the activity patterns, growth rates, life-histories, habitat use, nutrition, movement patterns and causes of population decline in these two species and collate the available information from the limited and mostly unpublished literature. The two species are threatened in different ways Placostylus fibratus is favoured as food, and as a result, has been over-collected from the wild, while P. porphyrostomus is threatened by habitat modification and destruction, and by predation by introduced rodents. We make several recommendations for the conservation of New Caledonian Placostylus which ultimately may depend on the work we describe here on captive breeding and management. Translocations to predator-free sanctuaries coupled with augmentation of existing populations may be necessary to maintain populations of these species in the wild.","2008","2021-01-25 17:36:00","2021-01-25 17:36:00","","13","","","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>1 - review but not relevant</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\ADWCI7ZT\Brescia et al. - 2008 - A review of the ecology and conservation of Placos.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
