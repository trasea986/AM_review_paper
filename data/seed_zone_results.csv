The term “local” has different meanings in different locales, since no single set of seed-collection zones has yet been widely adopted across the eastern United States. Given concerns about mitigating the effects of climate change, forest managers are increasingly seeking to move seed sources in a process called assisted migration, which would be facilitated if a common set of seed-collection zones were available. We developed a map of 245 seed-collection zones for 37 states by combining two ecologically important layers: plant hardiness zones and ecoregions. These new seed-collection zones should be used by seed collectors and nurseries to describe the origin of seed for plants and trees in the eastern United States. Common garden studies remain the gold standard for determining how far to move seed from any particular seed-collection zone. For species that have not been field-tested, seed movement that is limited either within a seed-collection zone or between adjacent seed-collection zones is a reasonable general guideline.","2020-07-01","2020-08-14 16:30:16","2020-08-14 16:30:16","2020-08-14 16:30:16","444-451","","4","118","","","New Seed-Collection Zones for the Eastern United States","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>5</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/5YT6P383/Pike et al. - 2020 - New Seed-Collection Zones for the Eastern United S.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly within the context of restoration, the evolution of genetic differences may impact success if seeds are maladapted to the restoration environment. In this study, we used Geum triflorum to quantify the scale over which genetic differences for quantitative traits important to adaptation have evolved, comparing the proportion of variance attributed to broad regional- and local population-level effects. Geum triflorum is a widely distributed species spanning a range of environments, including alvar and prairie habitats, which have extreme regional differences in soil-moisture availability. Alvar habitats are regions of thin soil over limestone that experience substantial seasonal variation in water availability, from flooding to desiccation annually. This contrasts with prairie habitats, whose deeper soils mitigate irregular flood–desiccation cycles. Using a common garden experiment, we evaluated 15 traits broadly grouped into three trait classes: resource allocation, stomatal characteristics, and leaf morphological traits for individuals sourced from prairie and alvar environments. We quantified the proportion of trait variance explained by regional- and population-scale effects and compared the proportion of regional- and population-trait variances explained across trait classes. Significant regional differentiation was observed for the majority of quantitative traits; however, population-scale effects were equal or greater than regional effects, suggesting that important genetic differences may have evolved across the finer population scale. Stomatal and resource allocation trait classes exhibited substantial regional differentiation relative to morphological traits, which may indicate increased strength of selection for stomatal and resource allocation traits relative to morphological traits. These patterns point towards the value in considering the scale over which genetic differences may have evolved for widely distributed species and identify different functional trait classes that may be valuable in establishing seed transfer guidelines.","2020-04-01","2020-08-14 16:30:53","2020-08-14 16:30:53","2020-08-14 16:30:53","plaa009","","2","12","","","The importance of quantitative trait differentiation in restoration","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/63PXLFNG/Yoko et al. - 2020 - The importance of quantitative trait differentiati.pdf","","","","Picó, Xavier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first step to define and implement cost-effective strategies is to identify specific priority populations. Mexico, in spite of being characterized by high levels of tree species diversity, mostly lacks a combined strategy for the genetic conservation and use of forest genetic resources. The aims of this work are: (i) to identify areas for gene conservation, and (ii) to propose measures for the conservation and sustainable use of forest genetic resources of four pine species: Pinus greggii Engelm. ex Parl., Pinus oocarpa Schiede ex Schltdl., Pinus patula Schiede ex Schltdl. & Cham. and Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl. To do that, we use the existing information on the distribution, genetic variation and conservation and breeding efforts in Mexico. Overall, 51 areas for establishing genetic conservation units were prioritized and 6 genetic zones for the use of forest genetic resources in breeding and selection of forest reproductive material were identified. The current conservation efforts for the four priority Mexican pines should be improved to satisfy the needs of a national breeding and conservation network.","2019-08-09","2020-08-14 16:32:00","2020-08-14 16:32:00","2020-08-14 16:32:00","675","","8","10","","Forests","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3? - AM and genetic BUT  genetic data from previous study.</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/WUB4EF9A/Flores et al. - 2019 - Priorities for Conservation and Sustainable Use of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear mixed model analysis was conducted using an approximate reduced animal model with a factor analytic (FA) variance model to estimate the complex additive (co)variance structure. Test sites were grouped according to patterns of G × E, and climate modelling was employed to project historical and future deployment zones for each group. Based on these findings, it appears that breeding groups with historically wide deployment zones from northern environments will become less important as the climate warms, and therefore investment should be directed toward southern breeding groups, which will be useful across a very wide geographic range in the near to mid-term future.","2018-07","2020-08-14 16:33:22","2020-08-14 16:33:22","2020-08-14 16:33:22","835-854","","7","48","","Can.

Forbes) was first introduced to Britain in 1830 but has not been widely planted and occupies a minute part of the forest estate. The results of six experiments established in the uplands of Britain examining material from 30 collection sites in 14 seed zones clearly demonstrate that its potential has not been recognised. The trials were assessed after 28 years and show that Pacific silver fir has the potential to be as productive as other common species options. There was little variation in performance between the 14 seed zones, and future seed collections could be carried out within a wide geographical range, including mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island and the Olympic Mountains and western Cascades of Washington. The silvicultural characteristics of the species mean that it could be used more widely to diversify forests in Britain both as a plantation species and in the wider use of continuous cover management. More work is justified to determine its susceptibility to Annosum root rot (Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref), confirm its productivity on sites with rainfall below 800 mm·a               –1               and (or) with a high peat content, and provide more detail on its wood properties.","2016-03","2020-08-14 16:38:45","2020-08-14 16:38:45","2020-08-14 16:38:45","427-436","","3","46","","Can.

Differences among provenances and between sites showed significance (p<0.05). Seedling growth showed a climatic and altitudinal pattern, in which seedlings from populations originating in low-middle altitudes had higher growth than populations originating in high altitudes, and from the extreme low altitude limit. Results were used to delineate climatic and altitudinal seed zones for contemporary and future climate zones in the decade centered in year 2030, using the average results of six climate-emissions scenarios. The results indicate that splitting the region into four seed zones is appropriate under contemporary climate scenarios with the following altitude limits: Zone 1, from 2300 to 2500 masl; Zone 2, 2500 to 2700 masl; Zone 3, 2700 to 2900 masl and Zone 4 from 2900 to 3100 masl. The equivalence on climatic intervals was also defined for mean annual temperature, precipitation and an annual aridity index (AAI). Values of contemporary AAI occurring at a given altitude by year 2030 were determined, with results suggesting that populations should be shifted 200 to 250 m attitudinally upward, through a program of assisted migration, to realign them to the future climate for which they are adapted.","2014-12-01","2020-08-14 16:46:12","2020-08-14 16:46:12","2020-08-14 16:46:12","139-148","","1-6","63","","","Altitudinal genetic variation among native Pinus patula provenances","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/7UGNP9ZF/Ruiz-Talonia et al. - 2014 - Altitudinal genetic variation among native Pinus p.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies were carried out in a Douglas-fir provenance trial plantation established at an altitude of 800 m a.s.l. on the northern slopes of Rila Mountain. To establish the productivity, assess the stands and rank provenances biometric procedures, methods of descriptive statistics and ANOVA were used. The diameter at breast height, average height, dominant height, total growing stock volume, assortment timber structure and survival of trees were analyzed in the stands of 55 Douglas-fir provenances. The provenances were characterized in terms of productivity of forest stands at 20 years of age and their ability to produce high quality timber was evaluated.

Seed transfer zones based on genetic variability and climate were developed using tapertip onion (Allium acuminatum Hook.) collected in the Great Basin and surrounding areas in the United States. Bulbs from 53 locations were established at two common garden sites and morphological (such as leaf and scape dimensions), phenological (such as bolting date and flowering), and production traits (such as emergence and seeds per plant) were measured. Differences among source locations for plant traits within both common gardens were strong (P < 0.001), indicating genetic variation. Principal component 1 (PC 1) for phenological traits, with R               2               = 0.59, and PC 1 for production traits, with R               2               = 0.65, were consistently correlated with annual, maximum, minimum, and average temperature, annual precipitation, and frost-free days at source locations (P < 0.05). Regression of PC 1 phenology and PC 1 production scores with source location climates resulted in models with R               2               values of 0.73 and 0.52, respectively.

The test evaluated trees aged 4.5 to 5.5 years, and contemporary and future (year 2030; six model-emission scenarios) climate variables were estimated. We found significant (P<0.005) differences among populations in total elongation, final seedling height, basal diameter, rate of elongation, dry weight of needles, branches and stem, total dry weight and first principal component. We found a significant association between population performance, expressed as first principal component values, and their climate, where the best climatic predictor was the frost free period (r               2               =0.90, P<0.0001). This result indicates that the patterning of genetic differentiation among populations is strongly associated with a climatic and altitudinal gradient. We propose a re-delineation of fixed climatic and altitudinal seed zoning for seed and seedling movement, based on intervals of 26 days of difference of frost free period: Zone 1, from 240 to 214 days of frost free period or 12 to 11°C or 3150 to 3350 masl; Zone 2, 214 to 188 days or 11 to 10°C or 3350 to 3550 masl; and Zone 3, 188 to 162 days or 10 to 9°C or 3550 a 3750 masl. Projecting at what altitude will occur the same frost free period values by year 2030, we suggested that populations should be shifted 400 m attitudinally upward, through a program of assisted migration, aiming to realign the populations to the climate for which they are adapted. Seedling deployment should use future (year 2030) fixed seed zones, with the same projected climatic interval values than contemporary climate, although at the following altitudinal limits: Zone 1               2030               , from 3550 to 3750 masl; Zone 2               2030               , 3750 to 3950 masl; and Zone 3               2030               , 3950 to 4150 masl.","2013-12-01","2020-08-14 16:47:17","2020-08-14 16:47:17","2020-08-14 16:47:17","86-95","","1-6","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p> <p> </p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/M5T4U6H6/Loya-Rebollar et al. - 2013 - Clinal variation in Pinus hartwegii populations an.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report on several AM efforts involving commercial tree species that are already underway in Canada and identify a number of initiatives that could be undertaken to help build AM capacity.

Plants from 148 Blue Mountain seed source locations were evaluated in common-garden studies at two contrasting test sites. Data on phenology, morphology, and production were collected over two growing seasons. Plant traits varied significantly and were frequently correlated with annual precipitation and annual maximum temperature at seed source locations (P < 0.05). Plants from warmer locations generally had higher dry matter production, longer leaves, wider crowns, denser foliage, and greater plant height than those from cooler locations. Regression models of environmental variables with the first two principal components (PC 1 and PC 2) explained 46% and 40% of the total variation, respectively. Maps of PC 1 and PC 2 generally corresponded to elevation, temperature, and precipitation gradients. The regression models developed from PC 1 and PC 2 and environmental variables were used to map seed transfer zones.

Current optimal breeding zones were based on 1961–1990 climate normals, and future breeding zones were based on three general circulation model (CGCM2, HADCM3, and CSIRO) predictions of 2041–2070 climate. Based on a maximum adaptive distance of 2.0 least significant difference values between sites within zones, 14 zones were required to cover the Ontario range of white spruce for the 1961–1990 data. Compared with breeding zones of other boreal conifers, current optimal breeding zones for white spruce were quite large, spanning up to 3° latitude and 10°–12° longitude and indicating large distances of effective seed transfer. Of the three general circulation models used to simulate future climate, HADCM3 B2 and CGCM2 B2 predicted 2041–2070 breeding zones that largely coincide with 1961–1990 zones. In contrast, CSIRO B2 indicated much narrower 2041–2070 breeding zones.","2010-08","2020-08-14 16:49:26","2020-08-14 16:49:26","2020-08-14 16:49:26","1576-1587","","8","40","","Can. J. For.

We coupled our previously developed hydrothermal time, thermal and hydrothermal afterripening time, and hydration–dehydration models for dormancy loss and germination with field seed zone temperature and water potential measurements from early summer through autumn to develop predictions of germination timing for               Bromus tectorum               at a semi-arid site in north-central Utah, USA. Model predictions were tested with a validation dataset based on concomitant seed retrieval experiments in 2 years. Predictions were generally in agreement with observed field germination time courses, even though integration across multiple precipitation events was necessary. Success of the modelling effort hinged on two factors. First, we used a soil capacitance sensor that measured seed zone (5 mm soil depth) water content accurately over a wide range. Second, simulations were built using physiologically based threshold models that can incorporate differences in germination timing for multiple germination fractions and for multiple stages of dormancy loss. Our results suggest that simulation models using hydrothermal time concepts can predict field germination phenology accurately. Seeds in this study integrated their experiences in a widely fluctuating environment in a manner consistent with the assumptions of hydrothermal time. Such threshold-based models also have the advantage of generality, as these concepts can be applied to many different species, environments and weather scenarios.","2009-12","2020-08-14 16:50:01","2020-08-14 16:50:01","2020-08-14 16:50:01","225-239","","4","19","","Seed Sci.

Much of the stock for this effort is selected to be climatically suited to the planting site—a match that is often facilitated through the development of seed zones. However, if climate change proceeds as predicted, stock that is well matched under current climate will be growing in sub-optimal conditions within the next 20 to 50 years—in some parts of the country, trees may already be growing outside their optimal climates. To provide a sense of the magnitude of these changes, we present past and predicted future climate trends for Ontario and British Columbia seed zones. For Ontario, over the period 1950 to 2005, minimum temperature of the coldest month has already increased by up to 4.3°C, growing season has lengthened by up to 6 days, and precipitation during the growing season has increased by up to 26%. Changes were more pronounced across British Columbia’s Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) seed zones, with minimum temperature increasing by up to 8°C, a growing season extension of up to 30 days, and growing season precipitation increases of up to 40%. Projections for the end of the current century include: minimum temperature increase of 5°C to 10°C, growing season extension of 31 to 60 days, and growing season precipitation increases of 3% to 42% across the seed zones in both provinces. These changes are certain to have extensive impacts on forest ecosystems.

This raises the question of how the results are affected by possible seasonal effects on germination energy and germination capacity of seeds. To answer this question, fluctuations in germination energy (GE) and germination capacity (GC) of Norway spruce (<I>Picea abies</I> [L.] Karst.) seed was determined throughout the year. The test seeds had been stored for either a short time (2 months and 1 year) or a long time (12 and 13 years). Seed testing was done according to ISTA rules two times (in the first year T1 and the second year T2) in each month during a year. Ten seed lots from five Norway spruce seed zones in Slovakia were used for each treatment. Obtained data were processed by analysis of covariance (independent factors – T and months, covariate – altitude of seed origin). The monthly germination indicators were compared to annual average (using absolute differences and relative seasonal indexes). The results showed that GE and GC of short-term stored seeds were 59% and 92%, and 35% and 81% for long-term stored seeds. Compared to the annual average, the monthly germination indicators fluctuated very differently: for GE three times more than for GC, for long-term stored seeds 2–3 times more than for short-term stored seeds. For GE, significant deviations were found in six months during a year (in the range 11–23%), for both variants of seed storage. In contrast, for GC values such deviations were confirmed only for short-term stored seeds in February and March, but the differences (–2%) were very small and can be neglected. For use in forestry practice, three methods that eliminate existing seasonal fluctuations are proposed. Seasonal indexes seem promising since they enable converting the observed germination indicators at any one time to a value characterising the entire year average (formula 3).","2008-09-24","2020-08-14 16:50:50","2020-08-14 16:50:50","2020-08-14 16:50:50","389-397","","No. 9","54","","J.

Open-pollinated seed from 16 populations along an altitudinal transect (1600 to 2450 m) were collected near Morelia, State of Michoacán, México. A common-garden provenance test, established with 2.5-year-old seedlings, was assessed for frost resistance conducting a laboratory frost damage test (-9°C). Results indicate that there were significant differences among provenances (P = 0.0261) for frost damage. Variation among provenances was structured as an altitudinal cline, with populations from lower altitudes being the least tolerant to frost. Linear regression statistics suggest that for each increment of 100 m of provenance altitude, there will be a 5.2% decrease in frost damage.

Total height growth (H), annual height growth (h), root collar diameter (RCD), branches per whorl (BW) and survival (SV) were measured and analyzed. Analysis of variance showed highly significant (p < 0.01; p < 0.001) differences between provenances for all traits, except survival, suggesting that selection at the provenance level could be possible. Also, over locations analysis revealed significant genotype x environment interaction, demonstrating that some provenances react differently to environmental conditions and, selection should take this into account. The phenotypic coefficient of variation was moderate for growth and high for number of branches per whorl suggesting that selection within provenance can also be applied. Finding of significant and highly significant age-age and trait-trait phenotypic correlations indicated that early and indirect selection in Swiss stone pine species is possible. According to DUNCAN’s multiple range test the best performing provenances of the two mountain ranges were selected for operational planting and breeding programmes. The results of this study validate that a very slow growing species, such as Swiss stone pine may still possess very high genetic variation in growth rate; consequently, this trait can be improved. Finally, an attempt has been made to develop a seed transfer guidelines for the species by using the pattern of geographic variation as a basis.","2007-12-01","2020-08-14 16:52:13","2020-08-14 16:52:13","2020-08-14 16:52:13","148-158","","1-6","56","","","Swiss Stone Pine Provenance Experiment in Romania","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>2 not specifically climate change</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/ZXWUQVTA/Blada and Popescu - 2007 - Swiss Stone Pine Provenance Experiment in Romania.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method involves two steps. First, a comprehensive set of candidate breeding zones is generated for a region using the focal point seed zone method. This method allows for control over the adaptive difference of genetic material within each zone. A grid of points is used to create the set of candidate breeding zones: one zone per point. Next, candidate zones are entered into a maximal covering location model formulated to suit this problem. The objective of this model is to select a subset of candidate zones that maximally covers the area of the region, given a limit on the number of zones to be selected and on the adaptive dissimilarity allowed within zones. Through use of this method, decision-makers can gain insight into how many breeding zones are needed to cover the region. Using different inputs from the focal point seed zone method, it is also possible to explore the trade-offs between the quantity and the quality of breeding zones. The method was tested on data from a series of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) common garden trials of 102 seed sources from northwestern Ontario.","2005-05-01","2020-08-14 16:52:39","2020-08-14 16:52:39","2020-08-14 16:52:39","1173-1182","","5","35","","Can.

The primary objective of this study was to assess geographic patterns of potentially adaptive differentiation in this self-fertile allotetraploid grass, and use this information to develop a framework for guiding seed movement and preserving adaptive patterns of genetic variation in ongoing restoration work. Progeny of 188 families were grown for 3 years under two moisture treatments and measured for a wide range of traits involving growth, morphology, fecundity, and phenology. Variation among seed sources was analyzed in relation to physiographic and climatic trends, and to various spatial stratifications such as ecoregions, watersheds, edaphic classifications, etc. Principal component (PC) analysis extracted four primary PCs that together accounted for 67% of the variance in measured traits. Regression and cluster analyses revealed predominantly ecotypic or stepped-clinal distribution of genetic variation. Three distinct geographic groups of locations accounted for over 84% of the variation in PC-1 and PC-2 scores; group differences were best described by longitude and ecoregion. Clinal variation in PC-3 and PC-4 scores was present in the largest geographic group.

First, an adaptive map is created by using conventional genetic test data. Then, the large array of predicted adaptive values is subjected to cluster analysis, which assigns each grid cell of the region to one of a predetermined number of clusters (breeding zones) such that the sum of the squared distances between each cell's adaptive value and its cluster mean is minimized. This approach minimizes the average adaptive distance between the origin of a breeding program's selected trees and planting locations throughout the region of focus. The procedure is illustrated by the use of adaptive values of 69 interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. × Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) open-pollinated families (sources) from southeast British Columbia, Canada. Adaptive values of each 1.5 km × 1.5 km grid cell in the 80 000-km               2               region were predicted using a geneco logical model (R               2               = 0.64), and the values were subjected to cluster analysis to identify breeding zone boundaries that were then mapped using a geographic information system. Regardless of the number of zones created, a regional maladaptation index was consistently smaller when zones were devised with area-based cluster (ABC) analysis than when zones were created by dividing the region into bands of equal elevational or adaptive-value widths. Application of the ABC procedure should assist in identifying the optimum breeding-zone alignment for a given number of zones.","2004-03-01","2020-08-14 16:52:47","2020-08-14 16:52:47","2020-08-14 16:52:47","695-704","","3","34","","Can.

Seedlings were grown for approximately two years in two shadehouse environments at Morelia, Michoacán, México and at Moscow, Idaho, USA. Total height was periodically measured during the second growing season to estimate a series of growth indexes for both locations, and dry weights were obtained only for the Morelia test. For the Moscow test there were significant differences (P < 0.05) among populations for cessation of growth, duration of the growth period, and final height. For the Morelia tests there were differences among populations for foliage, shoot and total dry weight (P < 0.025), and significant differences for stem dry weight at P = 0.055 level. There was a strong altitudinal cline for dry weight variables, with seedlings originated from populations from the lowest altitudes having more biomass (r2 = 0.80, P = 0.003). Populations separated altitudinally by about 295 m are likely to be genetically different. We suggest delineation of three altitudinal seed zones (Zone I: 2100 m to 2400 m; Zone II: 2400 m to 2700 m; Zone III: 2700 m to 3000 m), that can be translated into climatic zones delimited according to mean annual temperatures or by degree days > 5 °C. To accommodate climate change we suggest implementing assisted migration programs by transferring populations 300 m upwards to maintain adaptiveness of populations for future climates.","2012-06-30","2021-01-25 20:58:57","2021-01-25 20:58:57","2021-01-25 20:58:57","111","","2","35","","RevFitotecMex","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/MNQPM3V4/Sáenz-Romero et al. - 2012 - ALTITUDINAL GENETIC VARIATION AMONG Pinus pseudost.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The total    area of forest in which beech is present is approx. 1,652,400 ha. There is a    proportionate need to plant new forests and produce genetically high quality    seed and saplings. Biochemical analysis of the genetic structure of eight    populations of beech using ten enzyme systems from 16 isoenzyme gene loci    revealed significant differences between the populations analyzed. Variance    levels were high in some gene loci, while in some populations monomorphism    was recorded only for individual gene loci. The average number of alleles per    locus ranged from 2.1875 to 2.5625, and the average number of genotypes per    locus varied from 2.6875 to 3.2500. The multilocus genetic diversity at the    population level ranged from 63.276 to 162.001, and the genofund diversity    varied from 1.2708 to 1.3416.The average differentiation value obtained for    all populations was fairly low (Dj=5.81), indicating a percentage of overall    variance of about 94.194%.           ,              Provedenom biohemijskom analizom geneticke strukture sjemenskih sastojina    (populacija) bukve, uz upotrebu 16 izoenzimskih genskih lokusa dokazane su    znacajne razlike. Varijabilnost kod nekih genskih lokusa je velika, dok je    kod nekih populacija samo za neke genske lokuse registrovan monomorfizam.    Prosjecan broj alela po lokusu kretao se od 2,1875 kod populacije Bugojno i    Busovaca do 2,5625 kod populacije Kakanj, dok se prosjecni broj genotipova u    lokusu kretao od 2,6875 kod Busovaca do 3,2500 kod populacije Olovo. Kada je    u pitanju heterozigotnost, najveca je u populaciji Busovaca, a najmanja u    populaciji Bugojno. Neki od registrovanih alela predstavljaju rijetke alele,    kao sto je Pgi-B1, sto je veoma cijenjeno kod kasnijih utvrdjivanja porijekla    sjemena i sadnog materijala, te predstavljaju specificne markere tih    sastojina. Pored vaznosti za odredjivanje porijekla reproduktivnog materijala,    jako je bitno i za uspjesno provodjenje mjera gazdovanja. Negativne vrijednosti    fiksacijskog indeksa u istrazivanim sjemenskim sastojinama su pokazatelj da    posjeduju dovoljno geneticke varijabilnosti, te da se moze slobodnije    gazdovati istim. Pro tome ne bi izgubile mnogo od svoga genetickog    potencijala za adaptaciju. Ovo je registovano prije svega u populacijama    Busovaca i Prenj. Genetska multilokusna raznolikost kretala se izmedju 63,276 i    162,001, a najveca je u populaciji Bihac, dok se raznolikost genofonda    kretala od 1,2708 do 1,3416.Dobijena je srednja velicina diferencijacije za    sve populacije, koja je prilicno niska (Dj=5,81). Ova velicina pokazuje i    udio ukupne raznolikosti, koji se moze procijeniti na oko 94,194%. To je zbog    genetske raznolikosti medjupopulacijama i unutarpopulacija, te varijabilnosti    i slabe diferencijacije medjupopulacijama. Najvecu diferencijaciju pokazuje    populacija Bihac (8,28) sto ukazuje na veliku stabilnost i homogenost te    populacije spram drugih u ovom istrazivanju. Kako je ovim istrazivanjem samo    dana djelomicna geneticka struktura sest od 13 sjemenskih sastojina bukve u    Bosni i Hercegovini, potrebno je naglasiti potrebu daljih istrazivanja u    bilju geneticke rejonizacije ove vrijedne vrste. U tim poslovima posebnu    paznju treba posvetiti razgranicenju provenijencija (sjemenskih sastojina),    kao i na eksperimentalnu rejonizaciju temeljenu na ogledima provenijencija,    kroz istrazivanja ekolosko-fizioloskih svojstava. Tokom ispitivanja utvrdjeno    je postojanje visoko znacajne pozitivne geneticke korelacije izmedju pocetka    cvjetanja i duzine klasa, pocetka cvjetanja i mase 1.000 sjemena, broja    generativnih izdanaka i prinosa sjemena po biljci i duzine klasa i mase 1.000    sjemena.","2013","2021-01-25 21:07:28","2021-01-25 21:07:28","2021-01-25 21:07:28","895-906","","3","45","","Genetika","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3a - genetic - no trait - no association</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/TEJTTCL5/Ballian et al. - 2013 - Genetic differentiation in seed stands of European.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DJZSUN36","journalArticle","","Sáenz-Romero, C; Snively, Amy E; Lindig-Cisneros, R","Conservation and Restoration of Pine Forest Genetic Resources in México","","","","","","Deforestation rates in México are about 670,000 ha/year. This threatens the richness of forest genetic resources in México, causing the disappearance of locally adapted populations and rare and endangered pine species. México is one of the six megadiverse countries in the world, with half of the world’s Pinus species. Pinus is one of the most economically and ecologically important forest genera in México. We suggest that delineation of seed zones and the establishment of a network of Forest Genetic Resource Conservation Units (FGRCUs), linked with forest management and ecological restoration programs will protect this valuable resource. We estimate that FGRCUs should include 25 to 50 ha each, with at least one FGRCU for each priority species in each seed zone. We highlight the need for studies of adaptive genetic variation among pine populations and for new methodologies and techniques to suit ecological restoration under Mexican forest conditions. We briefly describe ongoing research on these topics on forests owned by a well-organized indigenous community in Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro, Michoacán, western México.","","2021-01-25 22:47:00","2021-01-25 22:47:00","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>5</p>","/Users/Luke/Zotero/storage/USK4WJ72/Sáenz-Romero et al. - Conservation and Restoration of Pine Forest Geneti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
