Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO               2               , resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.","2015-02-24","2020-08-14 17:31:07","2020-08-14 17:31:07","2020-08-14 17:31:07","2307-2313","","8","112","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>5 Suggests that genetic/genomic methods could be used to inform AM; broadly and briefly discuses these topics, but does not in any detail describe genetic/genomic methods to aid/inform AM</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\M58IVT4V\van Oppen et al. - 2015 - Building coral reef resilience through assisted ev.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most widely used approach is the “coral gardening” tenet; an active reef restoration tactic based on principles, concepts, and theories used in silviculture. During the relatively short period since its inception, the gardening approach has been tested globally in a wide range of reef sites, and on about 100 coral species, utilizing hundreds of thousands of nursery-raised coral colonies. While still lacking credibility for simulating restoration scenarios under forecasted climate change impacts, and with a limited adaptation toolkit used in the gardening approach, it is still deficient. Therefore, novel restoration avenues have recently been suggested and devised, and some have already been tested, primarily in the laboratory. Here, I describe seven classes of such novel avenues and tools, which include the improved gardening methodologies, ecological engineering approaches, assisted migration/colonization, assisted genetics/evolution, assisted microbiome, coral epigenetics, and coral chimerism. These are further classified into three operation levels, each dependent on the success of the former level. Altogether, the seven approaches and the three operation levels represent a unified active reef restoration toolbox, under the umbrella of the gardening tenet, focusing on the enhancement of coral resilience and adaptation in a changing world.","2019-06-28","2020-08-14 18:28:11","2020-08-14 18:28:11","2020-08-14 18:28:11","201","","7","7","","JMSE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>4/5 review that discusses (among other things) AM as a potential tool for coral restoration</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\5A2XLZ43\Rinkevich - 2019 - The Active Reef Restoration Toolbox is a Vehicle f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
