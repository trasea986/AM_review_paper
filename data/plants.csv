The test evaluated trees aged 4.5 to 5.5 years, and contemporary and future (year 2030; six model-emission scenarios) climate variables were estimated. We found significant (P<0.005) differences among populations in total elongation, final seedling height, basal diameter, rate of elongation, dry weight of needles, branches and stem, total dry weight and first principal component. We found a significant association between population performance, expressed as first principal component values, and their climate, where the best climatic predictor was the frost free period (r               2               =0.90, P<0.0001). This result indicates that the patterning of genetic differentiation among populations is strongly associated with a climatic and altitudinal gradient. We propose a re-delineation of fixed climatic and altitudinal seed zoning for seed and seedling movement, based on intervals of 26 days of difference of frost free period: Zone 1, from 240 to 214 days of frost free period or 12 to 11°C or 3150 to 3350 masl; Zone 2, 214 to 188 days or 11 to 10°C or 3350 to 3550 masl; and Zone 3, 188 to 162 days or 10 to 9°C or 3550 a 3750 masl. Projecting at what altitude will occur the same frost free period values by year 2030, we suggested that populations should be shifted 400 m attitudinally upward, through a program of assisted migration, aiming to realign the populations to the climate for which they are adapted. Seedling deployment should use future (year 2030) fixed seed zones, with the same projected climatic interval values than contemporary climate, although at the following altitudinal limits: Zone 1               2030               , from 3550 to 3750 masl; Zone 2               2030               , 3750 to 3950 masl; and Zone 3               2030               , 3950 to 4150 masl.","2013-12-01","2020-08-14 16:47:17","2020-08-14 16:47:17","2020-08-14 16:47:17","86-95","","1-6","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\M5T4U6H6\Loya-Rebollar et al. - 2013 - Clinal variation in Pinus hartwegii populations an.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instalou-se um teste de progênies, em viveiro, a partir de sementes de 48 matrizes amostradas nos Municípios de Rio Negrinho, Mafra e São Bento do Sul, no Estado de Santa Catarina; e em Lapa, Rio Negro, Campo do Tenente e Antonio Olinto, no Estado do Paraná. Das matrizes coletadas, 33 encontravam-se distribuídas em três grupos espaciais e 15 dispersas na região. O delineamento em blocos casualizados com oito repetições e 20 plantas por parcela foi empregado. Os dados avaliados incluíram: índice de velocidade de emergência, diâmetro do colo e altura das mudas (aos 61, 102 e 145 dias após a semeadura); sobrevivência, número de folhas por muda, massa seca da parte aérea e da raiz e área foliar da terceira folha totalmente expandida a contar do ápice. A metodologia de máxima verossimilhança restrita foi utilizada para a análise estatística, com o auxílio do software SELEGEN. Verificou-se que os caracteres juvenis apresentam elevado controle genético, podendo ser utilizados para avaliação da variabilidade genética de amostras de populações da espécie. Os três grupos de matrizes delimitados espacialmente não apresentam diferenças genéticas significativas, sendo possível inferir que as três áreas pertencem a uma mesma zona de coleta e uso de sementes           ,              The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic differences among three matrix groups of Cedrela fissilis based on quantitative juvenile variables on a progeny test to define seed collecting zones and use of seeds of this species in the study region as well as to evaluate genetic variability of the sampled material. A progeny test was established in a nursery with seeds from 48 seed trees collected in the municipalities of Rio Negrinho, Mafra and São Bento do Sul, state of Santa Catarina, and in the municipalities of Lapa, Rio Negro, Campo do Tenente and Antonio Olinto, state of Paraná. Of the collected seed trees, 33 sampled trees were distributed in three sites and 15 trees were dispersed in the studied region. It was used a complete random block design, with 8 replicates and 20 plants per plot. Evaluated data included: emergency rate; seedling base diameter and height (61, 102 and 145 days after the seeds were sowed); seedling survival; number of leaves per seedling; aerial section dry mass and root dry mass; and the foliar area of the third fully expanded leaf measured from the apical meristem. The Maximum Restricted Likelihood Method (REML) was used, using the software SELEGEN for analysis. It was found that the juvenile characters are strongly genetically controlled and they can be used to estimate genetic variability of population samples of Cedrela fissilis. The three groups of trees spatially limited did not significantly differ among each other, allowing to conclude that the three areas are part of the same tree seed transfer zone.","2012-02","2020-08-14 16:48:03","2020-08-14 16:48:03","2020-08-14 16:48:03","49-58","","1","36","","Rev.

To investigate the direct and indirect effects of litter on this interaction, we first collected field seed-bank samples from low and high               Bromus               litter patches. From these data, we explored the relationship between litter depth, seed-bank density and seed mortality from               P. semeniperda               . Second, we manipulated the fungal stages (conidial spores and mycelium) in/on the litter through sterilization techniques, to measure the direct effect of litter on seed death. Third, for indirect effects, we manipulated litter levels and held seed density and inoculum constant to determine whether               Bromus               litter could modify the seed zone microsites to favour disease. We found that seed-bank samples from high-litter patches contained higher field-killed seed densities compared with low-litter patches, although the percent difference of disease between litter patch types varied among sites and years (e.g. 80% to 46%). In testing the direct effects of litter on the seed–pathogen interaction, we found that litter can act as a direct inoculum source for the pathogen in the early summer but decreases in disease transmission by the following spring when the litter naturally is in contact with seeds. Investigating indirect effects, we found four times as many pathogen-killed seeds in high-litter treatments as compared with low-litter treatments when inoculum loads and seed densities were held constant. In addition, we found that litter influences the seed–pathogen interaction through density-dependent disease transmission. Our findings demonstrate the ecological importance of litter in semi-arid environments as it influences disease levels of a seed pathogen by direct and indirect means.","2012-06","2020-08-14 16:47:42","2020-08-14 16:47:42","2020-08-14 16:47:42","135-144","","2","22","","Seed Sci.

Seed source populations were sampled over a temperature gradient of 2°C, located up to 120km from the receiving site. Two receiving-site management treatments were applied: hand removal of exotic species, and exclusion of macropod grazing and trampling. There were no effects of weeding the receiving grassland and we concluded the low fertility of the site provided protection from exotic competition. After eight growing seasons, protection from grazing resulted in double to triple the numbers of established plants, depending on the species. Amongst populations within a species, larger seeds and early emergence reflected later establishment success for Bulbine only. At the species level, early performance was not indicative of later numbers of reproductive plants established. We found no long-term evidence of home-site advantage in any species, and no apparent disadvantage of non-matching lithology. All source populations were represented at the end of the experiment (Season 6). Counts after eight seasons’ growth indicated a continuing trend of population increase in all three species. The persistence of all populations suggests that admixture or climate-adjusted provenancing may be a realistic option to restore depleted populations of herbaceous plants in grassy eucalypt woodlands in a warming climate.","2018","2020-08-14 17:30:46","2020-08-14 17:30:46","2020-08-14 17:30:46","628","","8","66","","Aust.

This prediction, as well as many sustainable management and conservation practices, assumes that species are adapted to their current climate. However, this assumption is rarely tested. Using a large-scale common garden experiment combined with genome-wide sequencing, we found that valley oak (               Quercus lobata               ), a foundational tree species in California ecosystems, showed a signature of adaptational lag to temperature, with fastest growth rates occurring at cooler temperatures than populations are currently experiencing. Future warming under realistic emissions scenarios was predicted to lead to further maladaptation to temperature and reduction in growth rates for valley oak. We then identified genotypes predicted to grow relatively fast under warmer temperatures and demonstrated that selecting seed sources based on their genotype has the potential to mitigate predicted negative consequences of future climate warming on growth rates in valley oak. These results illustrate that the belief of local adaptation underlying many management and conservation practices, such as using local seed sources for restoration, may not hold for some species. If contemporary adaptational lag is commonplace, we will need new approaches to help alleviate predicted negative consequences of climate warming on natural systems. We present one such approach, “genome-informed assisted gene flow,” which optimally matches individuals to future climates based on genotype–phenotype–environment associations.","2019-12-10","2020-08-14 17:31:18","2020-08-18 03:38:39","2020-08-14 17:31:18","25179-25185","","50","116","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3a</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\BV864FL8\Browne et al. - 2019 - Adaptational lag to temperature in valley oak ( i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to this looming crisis, the calls for the translocation, or assisted migration, of species to ensure the survival of this biodiversity have been increasing. The concept has its detractors, and is not without risk, but few studies have documented the success of the approach or veracity of the risk. Here we review both the ecological restoration literature and the plant reintroduction literature to discover insights into the promises and pitfalls of translocating species as an adaptation strategy in the face of our changing climate. Although habitat restoration and the assisted migration of rare plant species have different objectives and goals, they share the practice of translocating species from their site of origin to a new one. It is primarily the scale at which the movement of those species occurs that distinguishes the two.","2016-02-06","2020-08-14 17:31:38","2020-08-14 17:31:38","2020-08-14 17:31:38","250-261","","4","63","","","Assisted migration as a climate change adaptation strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study considers provenance variation of 120 parent trees from 13 seed sources planted at five test sites in the Pacific Northwest. The unique, long-term nature of the study makes it valuable to revisit and consider its biological and historical significance. This analysis considers how far climatically Douglas-fir populations may be moved without incurring unacceptable declines in growth and survival. Results indicate that Douglas-fir seed sources may be moved at least 2° C cooler or warmer and still retain good long-term survival and productivity. However, projected future climate change beyond 2° C may lead to lower survival and productivity. One option to address these concerns is assisted migration; however, if seed sources are moved beyond 2–3° C to a cooler climate in anticipation of warming, or from a more continental to a maritime climate, we are likely to see increased mortality and associated losses in productivity in the near-term. Lessons from this study include: (1) pay attention to good experimental design; we were able to overcome limitations from the design by using new statistical approaches; (2) maladaptation may take time to develop; poorer survival was not evident until more than two decades after planting; and (3) long-term studies may have value for addressing new, unforeseen issues in the future.","2020-01-07","2020-08-14 17:36:30","2020-08-14 17:36:30","2020-08-14 17:36:30","1-13","","1","118","","","The 1912 Douglas-Fir Heredity Study","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b?</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\87ADQ7ZW\St. Clair et al. - 2020 - The 1912 Douglas-Fir Heredity Study Long-Term Eff.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) and white pine (Pinus strobus L.) seed sources across a study area centred on Ontario, Canada. The model accounts for climate change through the use of universal response functions, which (in principle) predict the growth of any seed source under any climatic conditions. We demonstrated the use of the model for two locations in northern Ontario; both species exhibited significant variation in NPV across the study area and significant gains associated with climate-smart seed movements. For example, the NPV associated with potential white pine seed sources varied by more than $1500·ha               −1               for a planting site at North Bay, Ontario. We also compared the NPV maps with climate similarity maps to examine the degree to which simple climate matching can act as a proxy for the detailed genecology relationships contained in the universal response functions. Overall, the climate similarity maps were well-correlated with the NPV maps; however, there was poor agreement regarding white pine seed deployment from North Bay, for which the two approaches identified opposite seed transfer directions. We propose that this situation can arise when species show strong adaptation to a central climatic optimum.","2015-10","2020-08-14 17:46:01","2020-08-15 18:21:04","2020-08-14 17:46:01","1248-1257","","10","45","","Can.

These include the physiological adaptations of the host tree (N uptake capacities among populations), matched to the particular amount and nature of soil N supply (organic N, NH               4               +               , and NO               3               –               ), as mediated by communities of site-adapted ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. The spatial attributes of an N economy may vary considerably over the ranges of tree species because of wide gradients in climate and soil fertility, underpinning a potentially important aspect of conifer genecology with implications for climate change mitigation. The evidence for an intersection of N supply with host demand, as mediated by EM fungi, will be briefly reviewed and then evaluated in light of assisted migration studies involving provenance trials of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) in southwestern British Columbia. The trials were established across a wide range of site types, and so they provide valuable data on host response to gradations in soil N supply and interactions with local EM fungal communities. Preliminary results and knowledge gaps will be discussed under the framework of an N economy and management of forest genetic resources.","2014-06","2020-08-14 17:45:58","2020-08-18 03:38:40","2020-08-14 17:45:58","417-423","","6","92","","Botany","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","00000","<p>3b</p> <p> </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Open pollinated seeds from fifteen A. religiosa populations were collected along an elevational gradient (2850-3550 masl; one sampled population every 50 m of elevational difference). Seedlings were evaluated in a common garden test over a period of 30 months. We found significant differences (P < 0.03) among populations in total elongation, final height, date of growth cessation, foliage, stem and total dry weight, as well as frost damage. These differences were strongly associated with the Mean Temperature of the Coldest Month (MTCM; r               2               = 0.6222, P = 0.0005). Seedlings originating from lower elevation populations grew more but suffered more frost damage than those from higher elevations. Populations differentiate genetically when they are separated by 364 m in elevation. Such differentiation was used to delineate three elevational/climatic zones for seed collection, with limits defined at: 2650 masl or 9.7 °C of MTCM; 3000 masl or 8.5 °C; 3350 masl or 7.3 °C; and 3700 masl or 6.1 °C.

This shift would exceed the highest elevations within the MBBR, necessitating the establishment of A. religiosa stands outside the MBBR, to serve as potential future overwintering sites.","2017-12-28","2020-08-14 18:22:24","2020-08-15 18:20:55","2020-08-14 18:22:24","14-23","","1","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","00000","<p>3b</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\J5X2VQCJ\Ortiz-Bibian et al. - 2017 - Genetic Variation in Abies religiosa for Quantitat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tree species living in rapidly changing climate conditions are exposed to danger and must adapt to new climate conditions to survive. Trees respond to changes in the environment in numerous ways. Physiological modulation at the seed stage, germination strategy and further development are influenced by many different factors. We review forest abiotic threats (such as drought and heat), including biochemical responses of plants to stress, and biotic threats (pathogens and insects) related to global warming. We then discus the varied adaptations of tree species to changing climate conditions such as seed resistance to environmental stress, improved by an increase in temperature, affinity to specific fungal symbionts, a wide range of tolerance to abiotic environmental conditions in the offspring of populations occurring in continental climate, and germination strategies closely linked to the ecological niche of the species. The existing studies do not clearly indicate whether tree adaptations are shaped by epigenetics or phenology and do not define the role of phenotypic plasticity in tree development. We have created a juxtaposition of literature that is useful in identifying the factors that play key roles in these processes. We compare scientific evidence that species distribution and survival are possible due to phenotypic plasticity and thermal memory with studies that testify that trees’ phenology depends on phylogenesis, but this issue is still open. It is possible that studies in the near future will bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms through which trees adapt to stressful conditions, especially in the context of epigenetic memory in long-lived organisms, and allow us to minimize the harmful effects of climatic events by predicting tree species’ responses or by developing solutions such as assisted migration to mitigate the consequences of these phenomena.","2020-01-21","2020-08-14 18:27:26","2020-08-18 03:38:40","2020-08-14 18:27:26","123","","2","11","","Forests","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\HAAYRF6U\Kijowska-Oberc et al. - 2020 - Adaptation of Forest Trees to Rapidly Changing Cli.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objective of this study was to examine the possibility of selecting superior jack pine provenances based on selected WQA. Twenty-two provenances of jack pine were planted in 1964 in Petawawa Research Forest, ON, Canada, as part of a provenance test. The plantation location offers conditions close to optimum for jack pine growth. Transition ages at breast height, determined with tracheids length, were computed with a piecewise model. Measurements at age 42 from seed were subjected to analyses of variance. Radial variations from pith to bark, as well as trends with seed sources origin of the selected WQA were also considered. A ranking was made based on a selection index built with four WQA. The provenances matured between 8 and 14 years, corresponding to 17%–48% of juvenile wood proportion. Significant differences among provenances were observed for ring width, ring density, tracheid length, and diameter at breast height but not for tracheid diameter, tree height, transition age, and juvenile wood proportion. None of the provenances ranked the best with all the selected WQA, but it was possible to find provenances exhibiting both high growth rate and good wood quality. A surprising result of this study was that tracheid diameter initially enlarged for 8 years, before declining toward the bark. It is possible to select provenances for a higher growth rate and for good physical (i.e., related to wood density) and anatomical (i.e., related to tracheid dimensions) wood quality attributes.","2019-11-05","2020-08-14 18:27:18","2020-08-14 18:27:18","2020-08-14 18:27:18","985","","11","10","","Forests","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\76LZJDAI\Mvolo et al. - 2019 - Effect of Seed Transfer on Selected Wood Quality A.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such information is not available for most plant species. Here, based on 69 provenances tested at 19 common garden experimental sites, we developed a universal response function (URF) for tree height at seven years of age for the important and wide-spread native Chinese tree species Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco. URF was recently used to predict the potential growth response of a population originating from any climate and growing in any climate conditions. The developed model integrated both genetic and environmental effects, and explained 55% of the total variation in tree height observed among provenances and test sites in China. We found that local provenances performed better than non-local counterparts in habitats located in central, eastern, and southwestern China, showing the evidence of local adaptation as compared to other regions. In contrast, non-local provenances outperformed local ones in peripheral areas in northern and northwestern China, suggesting an adaptational lag in these areas. Future projections suggest that the suitable habitat areas of P. orientalis would expand by 15%–39% and shift northward by 0.8–3 degrees in latitude; however, the projected tree height of this species would decline by 4%–8% if local provenances were used. If optimal provenances were used, tree height growth could be improved by 13%–15%, along with 59%–71% suitable habitat expansion. Thus, assisted migration with properly selected seed sources would be effective in avoiding maladaptation in new plantations under a changing climate for P. orientalis.","2019-07-25","2020-08-14 18:27:14","2020-08-18 03:38:40","2020-08-14 18:27:14","622","","8","10","","Forests","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p> <p> </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\W3ZAKU5I\Hu et al. - 2019 - Local Adaptation and Response of Platycladus orien.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Se evaluó la supervivencia y crecimiento de familias de Albizia plurijuga y Ceiba aesculifolia en un gradiente altitudinal y en dos laderas en la ciudad de Morelia, Michoacán, que sufre el efecto de isla urbana de calor. La supervivencia de A. plurijuga varió de forma significativa en función de la altitud sobre el nivel del mar, siendo menor a menor altitud (34% a 2050 msnm), y la altura de las plantas también fue diferente en cuanto a la altitud. Para Ceiba aesculifolia no hubo diferencias significativas al finalizar el experimento en cuanto a supervivencia a diferentes altitudes, pero sí entre laderas (noroeste 55%, sur 27%).

We compared the responses of two broadleaved tree species (               Fagus sylvatica               and               Quercus petraea               ) and two conifer tree species (               Pinus sylvestris               and               Picea abies               ) to climatic transfers by fitting models containing the same climatic variables. We used published data from European provenance test networks to model the responses of individual populations nested within species. A mixed model approach was applied to develop a response function for tree height over climatic transfer distance, taking into account the climatic conditions at both the seed source and the test location. The two broadleaved species had flat climatic response curves, indicating high levels of plasticity in populations, facilitating adaptation to a broader range of environments, and conferring a high potential for resilience in the face of climatic change. By contrast, the two conifer species had response curves with more pronounced slopes, indicating a lower resilience to climate change. This finding may reflect stronger genetic clines in               P. sylvestris               and               P. abies,               which constrain their climate responses to narrower climatic ranges. The response functions had maxima that deviated from the expected maximum productivity in the climate of provenance towards cooler/moister climate conditions, which we interpreted as an adaptation lag. Unilateral, linear regression analyses following transfer to warmer and drier sites confirmed a decline in productivity, predictive of the likely impact of ongoing climate change on forest populations. The responses to mimicked climate change evaluated here are of considerable interest for forestry and ecology, supporting projections of expected performance based on “real-time” field data.","2019-01-15","2020-08-14 18:33:09","2020-08-14 18:33:09","2020-08-14 18:33:09","e6213","","","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>3b</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\6443Q5BL\Sáenz-Romero et al. - 2019 - Common garden comparisons confirm inherited differ.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chihuahua spruce is only found in the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), Mexico. About 42,600 individuals are distributed in forty populations. These populations are fragmented and can be classified into three geographically distinct clusters in the SMO. The total area covered by                 P. chihuahuana                 populations is less than 300 ha. A recent study suggested assisted migration as an alternative to the                 ex situ                 conservation of                 P. chihuahuana                 , taking into consideration the genetic structure and diversity of the populations and the predictions regarding the future climate of the habitat. However, detailed background information is required to enable development of plans for protecting and conserving species and for successful assisted migration. Thus, it is important to identify differences between populations in relation to environmental conditions. The genetic diversity of populations, which affect vigor, evolution and adaptability of the species, must also be considered. In this study, we examined 14 populations of                 P                 .                 chihuahuana                 , with the overall aim of discriminating the populations and form clusters of this species.                                                        Methods                                Each population was represented by one 50 × 50 m plot established in the center of its respective location. Climate, soil, dasometric, density variables and genetic and species diversities were assessed in these plots for further analyses. The putatively neutral and adaptive AFLP markers were used to calculate genetic diversity. Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering technique and                 k                 -means clustering algorithm were used to classify the populations in the optimal number of clusters. Later stepwise binomial logistic regression was applied to test for significant differences in variables of the southern and northern                 P. chihuahuana                 populations. Spearman’s correlation test was used to analyze the relationships among all variables studied.                                                        Results                                The binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that seven climate variables, the geographical longitude and sand proportion in the soil separated the southern from northern populations. The northern populations grow in more arid and continental conditions and on soils with lower sand proportion. The mean genetic diversity using all AFLP studied of                 P. chihuahuana                 was significantly correlated with the mean temperature in the warmest month, where warmer temperatures are associated to larger genetic diversity. Genetic diversity of                 P. chihuahuana                 calculated with putatively adaptive AFLP was not statistically significantly correlated with any environmental factor.

Human-assisted migration has been proposed as a potential management option to maintain optimal health and productivity of Canada's forests; however, a better understanding of the ecological implications is needed to inform decision-making on assisted migration (AM). This paper examines the ecological constraints and consequences of AM, and discusses options for their mitigation at three scales: translocation over long distances (assisted long-distance migration), translocation just beyond the range limit (assisted range expansion), and translocation of genotypes within the existing range (assisted population migration). From an ecological perspective, we find that AM is a feasible management option for tree species and that constraints and consequences can be minimized through careful application of available knowledge and tools.","2011-12","2020-08-14 18:32:21","2020-08-14 18:32:21","2020-08-14 18:32:21","731-744","","06","87","","The Forestry Chronicle","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>5</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
