However, understanding genotypic, phenotypic and ecotypic variation is critical in determining the most suitable sources to conserve historical and functional variation. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) provide a classic example of restoration biology, where management programmes have re-established extirpated populations via translocations. Through this process, translocated individuals may now face novel environments, including new bioclimatic conditions and an opportunity to interbreed with historically isolated and distinct genetic units. Our goal was to integrate genetic and ecological analyses to assess some of the evolutionary ramifications of this important management practice. Location Western North America, but focused on the Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts. Methods We quantified genetic variation across 55 Herds of bighorn sheep using 16 microsatellite loci (N = 347) and a mitochondrial gene (N = 110). We used ordination, Bayesian clustering and phylogenetic analyses to delineate evolutionary units. We used multivariate ordination for 26 ecologically relevant variables to characterize niche-based differences among genetic clusters and then tested whether repatriated populations occupy conditions similar to source areas. Results We document genetic differentiation among three traditional management units of bighorn sheep that now occupy the Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts, but also identify limited hybridization among these groups. Niche-based analyses revealed that translocated populations now occur in conditions incongruent with source ranges. Main conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering both genetic variation and ecological differences when implementing translocations. Early consideration of these variables may help minimize the potential for hybridization among distinct groups and mitigate challenges of managing populations experiencing novel environments. More broadly, results from this study have implications for future restoration efforts in this iconic system, but also for similar translocation-based conservation programmes.","2015","2020-08-18 17:09:15","2020-08-18 22:51:25","2020-08-18 17:09:15","1063-1074","","9","21","","","Translocated to the fringe","","","","","","","en","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","00007  _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.12329","<p>3 - AG / translocations have been occurring, using genetics to monitor, using usats and mtDNA gets at ecotypes, movement was move for demographic reasons</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\B943GD34\Malaney et al. - 2015 - Translocated to the fringe genetic and niche vari.pdf; C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\MX522XQE\ddi.html","","","translocation; conservation genetics; assisted migration; managed relocation; Admixture; non-analogue niche","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many cases, however, limited funding and other logistic challenges limit the number of individuals available for translocation. In conservation genetics, small populations are predicted to rapidly lose genetic diversity which can deteriorate population survival. Thus, how worried should we be about the loss of genetic diversity when introducing small, isolated populations? Historical species introductions provide a means to assess these issues. Here we review 13 studies of “assisted colonization-like” introductions of animals, where only a small known number of founders established an isolated population without secondary contact to the source population. We test which factors could be important in retaining genetic diversity in these cases. In many cases, loss in heterozygosity (-12.1%) was detected, and more seriously the loss in allelic richness (-27.8 %). Number of founders seemed to have an effect but it also indicated that high population growth rate could help to retain genetic diversity, i.e. future management actions could be effective even with a limited number of founders if population growth would be enhanced. On the contrary, translocated organisms with longer generation times did not seem to retain more genetic diversity. We advocate that, where possible, future studies on translocated animals should report the loss of genetic diversity (both heterozygosity and allelic richness), which is essential for meta-analyses like this one for deepening our understanding of the genetic consequences of assisted colonization, and justifying management decisions.","2015-10-01","2020-08-19 01:25:54","2020-08-19 01:25:54","2020-08-19 01:25:54","827-834","","5","61","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>5 - meta analysis of assisted gene flow, summarizing the finding and patterns across 13 translocation case studies, although not climate change specific, ts</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\8V7DT5A9\Kekkonen and Brommer - 2015 - Reducing the loss of genetic diversity associated .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Local adaptation is one potential option, yet remarkably few studies have harnessed genomic tools to evaluate the efﬁcacy of this response within natural populations. Here, we show evidence of selection driving divergence of a climate-change-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps), distributed along elevation gradients at its northern range margin in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (BC), Canada. We employed ampliﬁed-fragment-length-polymorphism-based genomic scans to conduct genomewide searches for candidate loci among populations inhabiting varying environments from sea level to 1500 m. Using several independent approaches to outlier locus detection, we identiﬁed 68 candidate loci putatively under selection (out of a total 1509 screened), 15 of which displayed signiﬁcant associations with environmental variables including annual precipitation and maximum summer temperature. These candidate loci may represent important targets for predicting pika responses to climate change and informing novel approaches to wildlife conservation in a changing world.","2013-10","2020-09-10 20:38:42","2020-09-10 20:38:42","2020-09-10 20:38:42","3906-3917","","11","3","","Ecol Evol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>Not found in lit search but shows genomic studies related to Wilkening ideas - type 3</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\NIY6QIKC\Henry and Russello - 2013 - Adaptive divergence along environmental gradients .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assisted colonization, moving species into regions where they have not previously occurred, aims to establish populations where they are expected to survive as climatic envelopes shift. However, adaptation to the source environment may affect whether species successfully establish in new regions. Assisted colonization has spurred debate among conservation biologists and ecologists over whether the potential benefits to the threatened species outweigh the potential disruption to recipient communities. In our opinion, the debate has been distracted by controversial examples, rather than cases where assisted colonization may be a viable strategy. We present a strategic plan for the assisted migration of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), an endemic New Zealand reptile. The plan includes use of extant populations as reference points for comparisons with assisted-colonization populations with respect to demography, phenotypic plasticity, and phenology; optimization of genetic variation; research to fill knowledge gaps; consideration of host and recipient communities; and inclusion of stakeholders in the planning stage. When strategically planned and monitored, assisted colonization could meet conservation and research goals and ultimately result in the establishment of long-term sustainable populations capable of persisting during rapid changes in climate.","2012-10","2020-09-10 20:24:25","2020-09-10 20:24:25","2020-09-10 20:24:25","790-798","","5","26","","","Securing the Demographic and Genetic Future of Tuatara through Assisted Colonization","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>this was added manually and was found in our first search type 3 plan for future movement considering genetics and other factors, </p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\EC5RMHYX\Miller et al. - 2012 - Securing the Demographic and Genetic Future of Tua.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Suggestions have varied from choosing individuals from the most environmentally similar regions to choosing those that might have the best ability to adapt to new environments. Scott et al. used long-term data collected during translocations of Mojave Desert tortoises, including animals formerly kept as pets, to test these questions. Although the overall rates of survival for all tortoises at the site (both reintroduced and native) were extremely low, translocated individuals with the highest heterozygosity survived at much higher rates than those determined to be similar to the target population. Science, this issue p. 1086 Anthropogenic environmental modification is placing as many as 1 million species at risk of extinction. One management action for reducing extinction risk is translocation of individuals to locations from which they have disappeared or to new locations where biologists hypothesize they have a good chance of surviving. To maximize this survival probability, the standard practice is to move animals from the closest possible populations that contain presumably related individuals. In an empirical test of this conventional wisdom, we analyzed a genomic dataset for 166 translocated desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) that either survived or died over a period of two decades. We used genomic data to infer the geographic origin of translocated tortoises and found that individual heterozygosity predicted tortoise survival, whereas translocation distance or geographic unit of origin did not. Our results suggest a relatively simple indicator of the likelihood of a translocated individual’s survival: heterozygosity. High heterozygosity improves survival of reintroduced Mojave desert tortoises. High heterozygosity improves survival of reintroduced Mojave desert tortoises.","2020-11-27","2021-01-30 14:08:34","2021-01-30 14:08:34","2021-01-30 14:08:34","1086-1089","","6520","370","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science. https://www.sciencemag.org/about/science-licenses-journal-article-reuseThis is an article distributed under the terms of the Science Journals Default License.","","","","science.sciencemag.org","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science Section: Report PMID: 33243888","<p>4 used Radseq to monitor after movement</p>; <p>not found in lit search, published after we ran it I think</p>","C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\WDHF3WGR\Scott et al. - 2020 - Individual heterozygosity predicts translocation s.pdf; ; C:\Users\trase\Zotero\storage\KSDGTXLN\1086.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243888","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
